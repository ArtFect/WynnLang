§7[1/17] §2Elphaba: §aHmm, you might just be exactly what we’re looking for. If you want to join a top secret mission, follow me.
§7[3/17] §2Aledar: §aI... Am surprised to see you here. Looks like we’ve both come a long way.
§7[4/17] §2Lucio: §aCan you get a move on, please? We got our spare, let’s go!
§7[6/17] §2Elphaba: §aHundreds of years ago, people mined the surrounding areas around Detlas.
§7[7/17] §2Elphaba: §aThey eventually broke through to an entirely undiscovered area of the Wynn province.
§7[8/17] §2Elphaba: §aWhat they found.. Was not good. It was cursed. Not corrupted... This was something else.
§7[9/17] §2Elphaba: §aNo one really knows what’s beyond the mine because it was sealed to prevent the spread of a new threat.
§7[10/17] §2Elphaba: §aWe don’t have much intel, but it’s been named by some as the §aSilent Expanse§a.
§7[11/17] §2Elphaba: §aLately, creatures of darkness have been seeping through, and we think they are from the expanse.
§7[12/17] §2Elphaba: §aThe existence of this place has been kept on a strict need-to-know basis.
§7[13/17] §2Elphaba: §aOur mission is to make our way through the mine, observe and report the threat level.
§7[14/17] §2Lucio: §aCome on, we need to get going! Enough with the meetings!
§7[15/17] §2Aledar: §aHow many times do we have to tell you to stop doing that? Fix it, Lucio.
§7[16/17] §2Lucio: §aFine...
§7[1/12] §2Aledar: §aEveryone ready? I’ll lead.
§7[3/12] §2Elphaba: §aAledar...
§7[4/12] §2Aledar: §aI hear them too.
§7[5/12] §2Aledar: §aAh, no problem. I’ll take care of these.
§7[7/12] §2Elphaba: §aThis is actually our second attempt. The first time, it didn’t go too well.
§7[8/12] §2Elphaba: §aWe have more numbers now, Lucio and yourself should help us overpower it.
§7[9/12] §2Lucio: §aCan’t be that strong, bet I can take it myself.
§7[10/12] §2Elphaba: §aWe managed to seal it in but with the 4 of us I’m sure we ca-
§7[11/12] §2Lucio: §aLet’s just do it!
§7[12/12] §2Aledar: §aWait... No!
§7[1/4] §2Aledar: §aLucio! You FOOL!
§7[2/4] §2Lucio: §aWhat’s the big deal? You said yourself we can take it!
§7[3/4] §2Lucio: §aOuch...
§7[4/4] §2Aledar: §aWe need a PLAN.
§7[1/14] §2Lucio: §aThe plan is attack!
§7[2/14] §2Lucio: §aArgh!
§7[3/14] §2Aledar: §aLucio!
§7[4/14] §2Aledar: §aAhh!
§7[5/14] §2Elphaba: §aNo! Stop hurting them!
§7[6/14] §2Elphaba: §aOuch! This isn't working...
§7[7/14] §2Lucio: §aIs it just me or are our attacks doing NOTHING?
§7[8/14] §2Elphaba: §aLucio's right! Change of plan. Lucio, help me hold it in place.
§7[9/14] §2Elphaba: §aAledar, you know what to do.
§7[11/14] §2Aledar: §aI'll block it from attacking, you block it up with a spell.
§7[12/14] §2Aledar: §aThey won’t be able to hold it for long.
§7[13/14] §2Aledar: §aReady?! Cast any spell!
§7[14/14] §2Aledar: §aLucio, Elphaba! Run!
§7[1/7] §2Elphaba: §aWe all here? Where’s Lucio?
§7[2/7] §2Lucio: §aGuys… Any help? I'm stuck!
§7[3/7] §2Elphaba: §aPhew, here. Let me get you out.
§7[4/7] §2Lucio: §aI’m sorry, team. I’ve never seen a monster like that before.
§7[5/7] §2Aledar: §aIt looks like our problem isn’t firepower. It’s something else. It’s like our weapons just didn’t affect it at all.
§7[6/7] §2Aledar: §aI know someone who might be able to help us. A blacksmith on Black Road.
§7[1/1] §2Elphaba: §aJust in time. We’re all here.
§7[1/19] §2Elphaba: §aIt looks like the Blacksmith knows what’s wrong..
§7[2/19] §2Elphaba: §aSo, Dren. Do you know why we can't damage the beast?
§7[3/19] §2Dren: §aCertainly! Your issue is elemental. As you know, there are 5 elements...
§7[4/19] §2Dren: §aEarth...
§7[5/19] §2Dren: §aFire...
§7[6/19] §2Dren: §aAir...
§7[7/19] §2Dren: §aWater...
§7[8/19] §2Dren: §aAnd Thunder...
§7[9/19] §2Dren: §aBut.. There is a hidden element, §8❂ Darkness §a.
§7[10/19] §2Dren: §aIn order to damage a creature of Darkness, you must remove that influence from your soul.
§7[11/19] §2Dren: §aSome Dark creatures use a sort of synchronous barrier that prevents them being harmed by other creatures influenced with Darkness.
§7[12/19] §2Dren: §aIn order to purify you, I will need 2 powerful items.
§7[13/19] §2Dren: §aFirstly, a shard from a Dernic Beast. There is one living in the depths of the Roots of Corruption.
§7[14/19] §2Dren: §aI will use this to reveal the darkness element in you all.
§7[15/19] §2Dren: §aAnd then, of course, a Light item, to purify all of you...
§7[16/19] §2Lucio: §aWait... what do you mean a Light item?
§7[17/19] §2Dren: §aSomething from any Light creature would work, you could get some dust from Gavel fairies if you wanted.
§7[2/5] §2Aledar: §aWe found that the caves around the roots are far more complex than we thought...
§7[3/5] §2Aledar: §aThere’s one with far more powerful creatures... Somewhere... Here!
§7[4/5] §2Aledar: §aWhat are you waiting for? Let's go!
§7[1/4] §2Aledar: §aI’ve never used wings like this before...
§7[2/4] §2Aledar: §aI think if we just hold them and walk normally, it should help us glide across.
§7[3/4] §2Aledar: §aDon’t drop them and don't get hit by the lava geysers, obviously.
§7[4/4] §2Aledar: §aDon’t forget why we are here, we’re looking for a creature of darkness. Shout for me if you find one.
§7[1/2] §2Aledar: §aThat's our target! Go after it!
§7[2/2] §2Aledar: §aWait, why isn’t it fighting us here? Careful! It might be trapped!
§7[2/2] §2Aledar: §aWell, we got what we came for. Let’s head back to Dren.
§7[1/4] §2Dren: §aLooks like we lucked out on this one. Did you get an item of darkness?
§7[3/4] §2Dren: §aIt's done! You ought to be free of the dark influence. You ought to be able to break through that barrier that was giving you trouble.
§7[4/4] §2Elphaba: §aAre you sure? I don’t feel that different. Well.. I guess there’s only one way to find out.
§7[1/7] §2Lucio: §aEveryone here? Great! Time to finish what I started!
§7[2/7] §2Elphaba: §aLucio! No! When will you learn?
§7[3/7] §2Lucio: §aRight, yes. Sorry, what’s the plan?
§7[4/7] §2Elphaba: §aWe don’t want that thing to escape, it could cause widespread panic.
§7[5/7] §2Elphaba: §aWe’ll open up a small entrance to get in, and fight it once inside.
§7[6/7] §2Lucio: §aFine...
§7[7/7] §2Lucio: §aLet's go!
§7[1/6] §2Elphaba: §aWe... We actually did it!
§7[2/6] §2Aledar: §aThank grook for that. I was wondering if we’d ever be rid of this nightmare.
§7[3/6] §2Elphaba: §aWe have an extremely old map of the mines to help us, but we have no idea what’s waiting for us.
§7[4/6] §2Aledar: §aI want to warn you, this may well be a one way ticket for all of us.
§7[5/6] §2Lucio: §aYeah right! Check this out! 
§7[6/6] §2Elphaba: §aRocks are one thing, Lucio. The creatures we’re about to face require more than brute strength. You need force of mind.
§7[1/2] §2Lucio: §aOh my. Maybe this isn’t the best idea.
§7[2/2] §2Elphaba: §aIt’s too late now. We’ve got to finish this mission.
§7[1/16] §2Aledar: §aRemember the goal Elphie, we must reach the end of the expanse.
§7[2/16] §2Elphaba: §aIt’s still empty here. But it looks like they were here only yesterday.
§7[3/16] §2Lucio: §aI thought you said the miners were here hundreds of years ago?
§7[4/16] §2Aledar: §aThey were. I don’t know why it would be so well preserved. It’s as if nothing has touched it.
§7[5/16] §2Aledar: §aAccording to the documents, we need to make our way to the end of the road.
§7[6/16] §2Elphaba: §aArgh! Bugs! Get off!
§7[7/16] §2Elphaba: §aSo much for nothing being here.
§7[8/16] §2Elphaba: §aWhy are they only going for me?
§7[9/16] §2Elphaba: §aAledar, how far is it to the end?
§7[10/16] §2Aledar: §aI read the same map as you. It didn’t even have scale. There should be a bridge ahead, though.
§7[11/16] §2Lucio: §aUhh... A destroyed one. And it wasn't cause I blew it up this time!
§7[12/16] §2Aledar: §aHmm, well we will have to go around.
§7[13/16] §2Aledar: §aThis doesn’t really look like corruption, does it?
§7[14/16] §2Elphaba: §aUhhh... I'm not feeling really wel-... Aahhh!
§7[15/16] §2Elphaba: §aAaahhh! My liver! It took my liver!
§7[16/16] §2Aledar: §aElphaba! No! It's an illusion!
§7[1/45] §2Aledar: §aWhere has she gone?! ELPHABA?
§7[2/45] §2Lucio: §aAledar, maybe we should just double back now?
§7[3/45] §2Aledar: §aElphaba is an extremely able warrior. We will fight on and find her.
§7[4/45] §2Lucio: §aDo you really think it was just an illusion?
§7[5/45] §2Aledar: §aI’m not sure. I hope so.
§7[6/45] §2Lucio: §aWhat if we're infected too? Shouldn't we just go back?
§7[7/45] §2Aledar: §aWe can't, Lucio! We have a mission as you very well know. We continue.
§7[8/45] §2Aledar: §aBesides, we might be carrying some of those things too. We can’t risk them infesting Wynn.
§7[9/45] §2Lucio: §aLooks like we need to go around to the right, here?
§7[10/45] §2Aledar: §aIt feels like something is watching us...
§7[11/20] §2Lucio: §aAledar, what is this place? You didn’t tell me there was a city here.
§7[12/45] §2Aledar: §aThere is. A big one, too; there’s more ahead. But it doesn’t look like anyone’s home. The map doesn’t have a name for it either.
§7[13/45] §2Lucio: §aWait a sec, is that one of the miners? Is she hurt? HEEEEY! YOU OVER THERE!
§7[14/45] §2Aledar: §aLucio, no! It's a trap!
§7[15/45] §2Aledar: §aLUCIO! Don't get closer!
§7[16/45] §2Lucio: §aWait, what's going on? Why can't I move?!
§7[17/45] §2Obsessor: §4§lPlease, you have to understand!
§7[18/45] §2Obsessor: §4§lIt's so dangerous here!
§7[19/45] §2Obsessor: §4§lWe can't live alone like this!
§7[20/45] §2Obsessor: §4§lIt's too painful!
§7[21/45] §2Obsessor: §4§lListen to me!
§7[22/45] §2Obsessor: §4§lYou need to come with us!
§7[23/45] §2Obsessor: §4§lIt's the only way to keep you safe!
§7[24/45] §2Obsessor: §4§lIt's the only way to make you happy here!
§7[25/45] §2Obsessor: §4§lIt's the only way to make us feel whole!
§7[26/45] §2Obsessor: §4§lIT'S THE ONLY WAY, DO YOU UNDERSTAND?!
§7[27/45] §2Lucio: §aAAAH! S-Stop screaming at me! I can't understand!!
§7[28/45] §2Obsessor: §4§lWHY CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND?
§7[29/45] §2Obsessor: §4§lAM I NOT SPEAKING CLEARLY?
§7[30/45] §2Obsessor: §4§lCAN'T YOU HEAR WHAT I'M SAYING?
§7[31/45] §2Obsessor: §4§lYOU STAY OUT OF THIS!!
§7[32/45] §2Aledar: §aNo! How did she disable my spell?!
§7[33/45] §2Obsessor: §4§lPLEASE, WE NEED THIS!
§7[34/45] §2Obsessor: §4§lYOU'LL BE SO MUCH HAPPIER IF YOU COME ALONG!
§7[35/45] §2Obsessor: §4§lYOU'LL NEVER HAVE TO WORRY AGAIN!
§7[36/45] §2Obsessor: §4§lWE'LL KEEP YOU SAFE!
§7[37/45] §2Lucio: §a...aaaah..§a. Stop talking... H-help...
§7[38/45] §2Obsessor: §4§lJust please, stand still a little longer!
§7[39/45] §2Obsessor: §4§lWe'll bring you someplace warm!
§7[40/45] §2Obsessor: §4§lYou won't be hunted! We promise! No one hunts us!
§7[41/45] §2Obsessor: §4§lYou agree? YOU AGREE!
§7[42/45] §2Obsessor: §4§lTHANK YOU! WE WILL GO TOGETHER!
§7[43/45] §2Obsessor: §4§lYOU'LL BE SAFE WITH US!
§7[44/45] §2Obsessor: §4§lNO MORE FEAR! NO MORE CONCERN!
§7[45/45] §2Obsessor: §a§lForeeeever...
§7[2/7] §2Aledar: §aWe can’t stay here.
§7[3/7] §2Aledar: §aWho's that?! Elphaba?! Lucio?!
§7[4/7] §2Aledar: §aWait, you're just one of the miners. This doesn't feel like an illusion...
§7[5/7] §2Aledar: §aLook, you need to get out of here. It's not safe- Wait, what's that noise...?
§7[6/7] §2???: §4OURGURGH!
§7[7/7] §2Aledar: §a§lAAHHHHHHH!
§7[2/5] §2Aledar: §aI think my leg is broken. I have a potion to fix it, but I dropped it back up there.
§7[3/5] §2Aledar: §aI feel a bit better.. But something is still wrong.
§7[4/5] §2Aledar: §aLet’s just get out of here, soldier on. There's only one way out.
§7[5/5] §2Aledar: §aJump with me, come on!
§7[1/6] §2Aledar: §aAaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!!
§7[3/6] §2Aledar: §aI can’t walk. But equally we can’t stay here.
§7[4/6] §2Aledar: §aThe mission must be carried out. The plan has changed but it’s imperative we get to the end of this expanse, together.
§7[5/6] §2Aledar: §aThere has to be a way.. Even if you have to push me in this thing!
§7[6/6] §2Aledar: §aNo, I’m not joking. You guard the cart, I’ll lead the way.
§7[1/8] §2Aledar: §aAccording to the map, the miners started a town a little ahead.
§7[2/8] §2Aledar: §aWho knows what's left, but it’s got to be safer than here.
§7[3/8] §2Aledar: §aI think the §a§lSmall Monsters §awill try to §a§lKill me§a.
§7[4/8] §2Aledar: §aWhile the §a§lBig Monsters §awill try to §a§lKill you§a.
§7[5/8] §2Aledar: §aIt’s going to be on you to make sure we both get through this.
§7[6/8] §2Aledar: §aThe fate of the mission relies on the two of us working together.
§7[7/8] §2Aledar: §aAre those… Eyes on the trees?
§7[1/1] §2Aledar: §aAnother one's coming! Pay attention!
§7[1/1] §2Aledar: §aGreat job! It looks like they've stopped coming. Let's keep going.
§7[1/1] §2Aledar: §aLet's keep going! Before they come back.
§7[1/1] §2Aledar: §aA lot of those small ones are coming for me!
§7[1/1] §2Aledar: §aThis one was close! We're getting close to the town.
§7[1/1] §2Aledar: §aWe'll have to stop again! We can't go past so many monsters.
§7[1/1] §2Aledar: §aWe're almost there! I can see the town from here!
§7[1/1] §2Aledar: §aOh no!
§7[1/7] §2Aledar: §aFinally, we've arrived... It’s not exactly the town on the map.
§7[2/7] §2Aledar: §aThe lost miners are here… How? they must be hundreds of years old!
§7[3/7] §2Aledar: §aWhat is this obelisk? It’s.. oddly comforting. I recognise this feeling from my time in Gavel.
§7[4/7] §2Aledar: §aMaybe.. It’s been touched by the light? If so.. It could heal me.
§7[5/7] §2Aledar: §aLet’s see if it does anything to me...
§7[6/7] §2Aledar: §aIt worked... Kind of. I feel at least 70%. We still have a ways to go.
§7[7/7] §2Aledar: §aLet’s take some time to gather ourselves before we press on. I’ll meet you on the other side of town.

§7[1/1] §2Aledar: §aWatch out, the small monsters are coming for me! I can’t fight in this thing!
§7[1/1] §2Dren: §aStay there, don't try leaving until we're done with the purification.
§7[1/1] §2Aledar: §aStay with me!
§7[1/1] §2Elphaba: §aWhere do you think you're going... you can't enter! Do you want me to use a spell on you to take you out of here?!
§7[1/2] §2Elphaba: §aWhere do you think you're going?! This is the most dangerous mission in the history of this province that only the strongest and bravest can face!
§7[2/2] §2Elphaba: §aCome back when you are level 100 and then I might allow you to take part in this mission!
§7[1/1] §2Aledar: §aWhat do you think you're doing? You can't just jump in the lava like that.
