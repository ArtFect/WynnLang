§7[1/8] §2Dr. Picard: §aSUCCESS! I can see clearly now.. My memories from years ago!
§7[2/8] §2Dr. Picard: §aOh, a soldier! Are you by any chance from Fruma?
§7[3/8] §2Dr. Picard: §aTell me, do you remember anything about where you came from?
§7[4/8] §2Dr. Picard: §aI thought so. Everyone's story starts the same - In a wagon entering the Wynn province.
§7[5/8] §2Dr. Picard: §aI want to find out more. I've just created this orb which allows me to see people's past.
§7[6/8] §2Dr. Picard: §aSay, would you help me? I need some people originally from Fruma. Can you bring them here?
§7[7/8] §2Dr. Picard: §aThere is another guard just across the bridge.
§7[8/8] §2Dr. Picard: §aSee if he would oblige this experiment. I'm sure they want to find out more.
§7[1/3] §2Scout Reynauld: §aOh, good! Reinforcements! I've been left here alone to defend Elkurn.
§7[2/3] §2Scout Reynauld: §aSeriously? You want me to abandon my post? I'm expecting a huge attack from the Roots.
§7[3/3] §2Scout Reynauld: §aFine, listen. If you help me defend the town, I'll go with you!
§7[1/1] §2Scout Reynauld: §aAlright, here we are. Let me know when you're ready.
§7[1/4] §2Scout Reynauld: §aOh boy, here they come!
§7[2/4] §2Scout Reynauld: §aWow! Erected spikes, too?!
§7[3/4] §2Scout Reynauld: §aThere's a Corrupted summoner on the other side of this bridge! We gotta destroy it!
§7[4/4] §2Scout Reynauld: §aDefend me while I prepare my explosive arrows to bring down those towers blocking your path to it!
§7[1/1] §2Scout Reynauld: §aMy arrow's almost ready...
§7[1/1] §2Scout Reynauld: §aYes! One down, one to go! You're doing great!
§7[1/1] §2Scout Reynauld: §aAH! I'm hurt! Come here and help!
§7[1/3] §2Scout Reynauld: §aAgh... Thanks for the rescue...
§7[2/3] §2Scout Reynauld: §aTry not to let me get overwhelmed. Now, let's try this again.
§7[3/3] §2Scout Reynauld: §aGet ready!
§7[1/1] §2Scout Reynauld: §aAlmost got this arrow nocked...
§7[1/1] §2Scout Reynauld: §aBullseye! Now's your chance, go take out that summoner!
§7[1/1] §2Scout Reynauld: §aGreat job, you did it! Now, come back and get these monsters off me!
§7[1/4] §2Scout Reynauld: §aPhew. Thanks for the help, not sure I could have done that alone.
§7[2/4] §2Scout Reynauld: §aSo, you want to find out about our past?
§7[3/4] §2Scout Reynauld: §aWell, I must admit I never really thought about it. I guess I could go with you.
§7[4/4] §2Scout Reynauld: §aLead the way, but quick. We can't leave Elkurn unguarded for too long.
§7[1/7] §2Dr. Picard: §aAh, I see you have the soldier.
§7[2/7] §2Scout Reynauld: §aSo how exactly were you planning on extracting my memory?
§7[3/7] §2Dr. Picard: §aIn a non painful way, I promise you. Now, if you'll stand over here, please.
§7[4/7] §2Scout Reynauld: §aYou mean in front of that crystal thing? Alright...
§7[5/7] §2Scout Reynauld: §aDo I just look into it?
§7[6/7] §2Dr. Picard: §aJust stare into its depths and let that depth reflect into your mind...
§7[7/7] §2Scout Reynauld: §aI don’t feel any- WOAH
§7[1/12] §2Reynauld: §a*Sigh*, what a day.
§7[2/12] §2Reynauld: §aIs the water any better?
§7[3/12] §2Heine: §a*Sigh*, there's barely enough for us and the horses.
§7[4/12] §2Heine: §aI don't see why the Royalty has to irrigate from our rivers.
§7[5/12] §2Imperial Guard: §aThe Palace has ordered an inquest into the productivity of this village. You are behind on your crop deliveries.
§7[6/12] §2Reynauld: §aSir, we tried but the farms don't have enough clean water since the Palace dammed up the river!
§7[7/12] §2Imperial Soldier: §aAre you insulting the work of our royal engineers?
§7[8/12] §2Reynauld: §aWhat? No! I'm just explaining- Please! I have a family I didn't speak out of turn.
§7[9/12] §2Reynauld: §aHeine? Look after the kids. I'll be back soon!
§7[10/12] §2Imperial Guard: §aThe Palace does not tolerate insubordination. Reynauld you are to be tried for Lèse-majesté.
§7[11/12] §2Imperial Guard: §aThis village would do well to remember who protects them from external forces.
§7[12/12] §2Dr. Picard: §aHey. HEY! It's not real. Just a memory! Talk to me!
§7[1/5] §2Dr. Picard: §aWell, that was unexpected. I didn't anticipate subjects would relive them that vividly.
§7[2/5] §2Dr. Picard: §aTo think Reynauld had a whole family and life before he came here.
§7[3/5] §2Dr. Picard: §aDo you think you could get me one more subject? We need to find out more.
§7[4/5] §2Dr. Picard: §aThere's a sailor close to Elkurn from Fruma. Maybe you could go ask him?
§7[5/5] §2Dr. Picard: §aCross the bridge you took earlier and continue past Elkurn. He should be by the river.
§7[1/5] §2Caid: §aYep, I'm the sailor. Pretty sure I'm from Fruma, came here on the same cart as you.
§7[2/5] §2Caid: §aI'm not sure I want to know about it... I must have left for a reason, right?
§7[3/5] §2Caid: §aWait, Reynauld had his done? Hmm, I guess it couldn't hurt.
§7[4/5] §2Caid: §aHowever, I have an issue. I've navigated my boat into a creek instead of the river..
§7[5/5] §2Caid: §aMaybe we can use some magic to shrink the boat? Maybe someone in Elkurn knows? An alchemist maybe?
§7[1/6] §2Alchemist: §aLooking for potions?
§7[2/6] §2Alchemist: §aThis is the best potion shop in Elkurn! A what? Excuse me?
§7[3/6] §2Alchemist: §aA shrinking potion? No, we do not sell those here...
§7[4/6] §2Alchemist: §aOr... hold up. I think I know how to make one, I've never done it before though.
§7[5/6] §2Alchemist: §aIf I remember correctly... I need §3[1 Golden Apple]§a, §3[1 Bottle of Water] §aand lastly, §3[1 Bloom of Doom].
§7[6/6] §2Alchemist: §aGolden apples grow in certain big apple trees. Bottles of water should be available here in town. Blooms of Doom grow near death, try looking near the Elkurn church. Watch out, they aren't the friendliest.
§7[1/5] §2Caid: §aYou know, the more I look at this, the more I wonder how I did this.
§7[2/5] §2Caid: §aThanks for getting the potion. Let's see if it works. If it does I'll follow you to the tower.
§7[3/5] §2Caid: §a...
§7[4/5] §2Caid: §aI mean... It certainly shrunk. Do I even fit now?
§7[5/5] §2Caid: §aI guess you held up your side of the deal. I'll follow you.
§7[1/5] §2Dr. Picard: §aAhhh, another Fruman. Let's see if his story is the same as Reynauld's.
§7[2/5] §2Sailor Caid: §aI am still not sure about this, I'm kind of happy here.
§7[3/5] §2Dr. Picard: §aNothing to worry about, it won't change who you are now.
§7[4/5] §2Dr. Picard: §aWait for it...
§7[5/5] §2Sailor Caid: §aHold up. What is going on?
§7[1/7] §2???: §aAHHH!!!!!
§7[2/7] §2Imperial Guard §aMove.
§7[3/7] §2Caid §aCARA! 
§7[4/7] §2Imperial Guard: §aCara is under arrest. She is coming with me.
§7[5/7] §2Caid: §aGET YOUR HANDS OFF OF HER!
§7[6/7] §2Imperial Guard §aPerhaps you would like to go in her place? 
§7[7/7] §2Dr. Picard: §aHey. Earth to human.
§7[1/4] §2Dr. Picard: §aHmmm... This doesn't look too good.
§7[2/4] §2Dr. Picard: §aJust what is happening in Fruma? They've locked that province away for hundreds and hundreds of years and now this?
§7[3/4] §2Dr. Picard: §aWe should see if we can uncover more about Fruma.
§7[4/4] §2Dr. Picard: §aEdwin could be our next subject, he lives near the Nesaak border, just take the road south of here and you'll see his farmhouse.
§7[1/5] §2Edwin: §aFruma? Don't remember nothing. Don't want to neither.
§7[2/5] §2Edwin: §aNo, I don't. I have more important things to think about than some mystery province.
§7[3/5] §2Edwin: §aWell, my water source has frozen over and my crops are struggling.
§7[4/5] §2Edwin: §aIt's like the snow has slowly been encroaching on my farm.
§7[5/5] §2Edwin: §aCan you climb up the mountain and break through it? If you can water my plants I will go with you. There's a cave next to my farm that leads to the top.
§7[1/3] §2Edwin: §aYou army folk sure keep your promises.
§7[2/3] §2Edwin: §aI guess I have to hold up my end.
§7[3/3] §2Edwin: §aLead the way.
§7[1/5] §2Dr. Picard: §aAh, I see you have the third subject.
§7[2/5] §2Edwin: §aPfft! I'm not some subject!
§7[3/5] §2Dr. Picard: §aMy apologies. Please, stand in front of the orb.
§7[5/5] §2Edwin: §aWAAAAO!!!!!!!
§7[1/23] §2Edwin: §aWhy are you doing this!?
§7[2/23] §2Imperial Guard: §aOrder of her majesty.
§7[3/23] §2Edwin: §aLET ME OUT! WHAT IS THIS!
§7[4/23] §2Caid: §aHey you. Calm down. There's no point in yelling...
§7[5/23] §2Edwin: §aWhat... what do you mean?
§7[6/23] §2Caid: §aThere is no escape here. The guards come in once in a while and take people... people who are never seen again...
§7[7/23] §2Edwin: §aWhere are they being taken?
§7[8/23] §2Caid: §aNo one knows... The last person they took was... Alen? Alida? Alegar?
§7[9/23] §2Imperial Guard: §aCaid! You are being transfered.
§7[10/23] §2Caid: §aWh-what. I... don't want to go!
§7[11/23] §2Imperial Guard: §aWalk. Or you will be executed on the spot.
§7[12/23] §2Caid: §aWhat are you doing!?
§7[13/23] §2Imperial Guard: §aShut it.
§7[14/23] §2Imperial Guard: §aThere is no war inside the Fruman walls.
§7[15/23] §2Imperial Guard: §aThere is no war inside the Fruman walls.
§7[16/23] §2Imperial Guard: §aThere is no war inside the Fruman walls.
§7[17/23] §2Imperial Guard: §aThere is no war inside the Fruman walls.
§7[18/23] §2Imperial Guard: §aThere is no war inside the Fruman walls.
§7[19/23] §2Imperial Guard: §aThere is no war inside the Fruman walls.
§7[20/23] §2Imperial Guard: §aThere is no war inside the Fruman walls.
§7[21/23] §2Imperial Guard: §aThere is no war inside the Fruman walls.
§7[23/23] §2Dr. Picard: §aYou need to find an exit or you will be sucked into the memory without chance of returning. HURRY!
§7[1/5] §2Dr. Picard: §aOkay, three Frumans have seen the same thing. Why are they sending their people here?
§7[2/5] §2Dr. Picard: §aThis asks more questions than it answers. Those people didn't do anything wrong.
§7[3/5] §2Dr. Picard: §aThe only thing left is to check your own memory. To see if you also experienced the same thing.
§7[4/5] §2Dr. Picard: §aStand on this red carpet here and we'll get started.
§7[5/5] §2Dr. Picard: §aWait for it...
§7[1/4] §2Dr. Picard: §aAre you okay?
§7[2/4] §2Dr. Picard: §aThe other subjects never experienced that powerful of a reaction, it's almost like we were accessing memories that never existed.
§7[3/4] §2Dr. Picard: §aIt's almost as if you didn't have a life before you came to Wynn.
§7[4/4] §2Dr. Picard: §aI need to do more research on this, thank you for helping me. Here's a small reward, hope we can discover what really goes on behind the walls of Fruma.

§7[1/1] §2Dr. Picard: §aHello, again! If you want to reset your skill points, use my assistant to my right!
§7[1/2] §2Dr. Picard: §aGah, I could really use a Fruman brain right now... Oh, hey! You're Fruman, right?
§7[2/2] §2Dr. Picard: §aWell, you're still not quite experienced enough to aid me... Come back when you're level 25, then we can talk.
§7[1/1] §2Alchemist: §aNice to meet you again. I heard the shrinking potion actually worked, which is quite interesting.
§7[1/1] §2Dr. Picard: §aAre you getting my test subjects for me?
§7[1/1] §2Alchemist: §aIf you have the items, mix them together in the brewing stand next to me.
§7[1/1] §2Alchemist: §aArgh... Not like that... Oh, hello there! If you are looking for a potion I'm unfortunately a bit busy... Try coming back later.
