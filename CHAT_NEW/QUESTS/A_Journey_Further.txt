§7[2/2] §2Aledar: §aTalk to me when you are ready to go. But remember, we're on a mission. We won't be returning until it's finished.
§7[1/2] §2Aledar: §aAlright, let's go. I'll tell you more about our journey on the way.
§7[2/2] §2Aledar: §aWe should try to follow the path as closely as we can. You lead, I'll follow.
§7[1/2] §2Aledar: §aStop! Did you hear that?
§7[1/5] §2Aledar: §aGood work. Seems that killing the king made the other creatures run off. We're lucky about that-
§7[3/5] §2Aledar: §aOh, no no no! I have a potion for this, where is it, where is it, aha! Here, drink!
§7[4/5] §2Aledar: §aOne of those things must have infected your wounds... Everything in this area looks completely hazardous and sickening.
§7[5/5] §2Aledar: §aI expected the worst, so I tried to bring anything and everything that might help. Let's keep moving.
§7[1/9] §2Aledar: §aLOOK OUT!
§7[3/9] §2Aledar: §aI'm... I'm going to lead us for now. At least for a §alittle...while..§a. I can't have you g-getting-
§7[4/9] §2Aledar: §aGAH!! AAAGH!
§7[5/9] §2Aledar: §a...urgh..§a. §aI...sorry§a. I just... I need a moment.
§7[7/9] §2Aledar: §aI want to stress this... We NEED to get to the end of this path, together.
§7[8/9] §2Aledar: §aHrk... Ugh, dizzy...
§7[9/9] §2Aledar: §aOkay. I'm as good as I can get right now. Let's move.
§7[1/3] §2Aledar: §aAh? What... What just... Why do I...
§7[2/3] §2Aledar: §aI'll be fine, I §ajust...why§a did I feel so empty all of the sudden...?
§7[1/12] §2Aledar: §aHuff... Not feeling totally better, but... At least I can still defend myself.
§7[2/12] §2Aledar: §aMy stomach is empty, I can't even vomit... Why do I still feel so dizzy? Maybe a potion will help...
§7[3/12] §2Aledar: §aHm. No, not that one...
§7[4/12] §2Aledar: §aUrgh, pfft! My vomit tasted better than that coming up...
§7[5/12] §2Aledar: §aHah...that's§a the ticket. Which potion was this anyways... §a...hair§a loss treatment? Why did THAT work?
§7[6/12] §2Aledar: §aThough, you saw what happened to that beast I attacked? Follow me.
§7[7/12] §2Aledar: §aThis, from what I recall of the mission statements, is referred to as a “Void Hole.” It's a sort of portal.
§7[8/12] §2Aledar: §aThey connect to each other in odd ways, but we saw the beast come out of that one when I knocked it in, so...
§7[9/12] §2Aledar: §aWatch. I'll come out the other side.
§7[10/12] §2Aledar: §aAlright, good! It does connect up consistently, at least. You try now.
§7[11/12] §2Aledar: §aI bring this up because if we're seeing one, we'll be seeing more soon. You'll need to adjust yourself to the sight of them.
§7[12/12] §2Aledar: §aYou lead again, please.
§7[1/3] §2Aledar: §aWe grossly underestimated the difficulties we would have here. And, by that, I mean myself, Elphie, and Lucio did...
§7[2/3] §2Aledar: §aWe were each unprepared and cocky. If it weren't for you, I'd be dead now, for what it's worth.
§7[3/3] §2Aledar: §aI wasn't certain at first about you coming along, but you've more than shown you were the right one for the job.
§7[1/11] §2Aledar: §a...I had to figure this map was outdated. This wall of spikes isn't listed on it, and the path goes through here!
§7[2/11] §2Aledar: §aI'll have to assume they're §anew...and§a if they're new, I might be able to bash through them.
§7[4/11] §2Aledar: §aOk, 3... 2... 1...!
§7[5/11] §2Aledar: §a...aagh..§a. I... H-how are these so resilient...?
§7[6/11] §2Aledar: §aI'm an idiot... I nearly killed myself trying that. I nearly ruined the mission...
§7[7/11] §2Aledar: §aI'm sorry, but you'll have to go without me. I can't move another step for now.
§7[8/11] §2Aledar: §aThere's a lot of void holes around here, remember my warning... You can probably get past these spikes with one.
§7[9/11] §2Aledar: §aIf I'd been thinking I would have suggested it earlier... Once you're past, we'§all...uh§a. We'll do something.
§7[10/11] §2Aledar: §aJust...be§a careful where you go. The void holes could lead anywhere. They might lead you someplace very, very dangerous, too dangerous even for you. I pray they won't...
§7[11/11] §2Aledar: §aThere's a void hole right there to try out first. Get going, now. You have to do this.
§7[2/5] §2Aledar: §aI don't know what you did, but whatever it was, it's made cracks in the spikes that I can see from this side.
§7[3/5] §2Aledar: §aI've got some of my energy §aback...let's§a try spellcasting again. If we do it at the same time, we might make some headway.
§7[4/5] §2Aledar: §aI won't crack my skull open on the spikes again though. Promise.
§7[5/5] §2Aledar: §aYou lead. I'll cast my spell as soon as I hear yours.
§7[1/20] §2Aledar: §aThank god it worked... That's our destination there, the Eldritch Outlook.
§7[2/20] §2Aledar: §aNow comes the hardest part... Come along. I'll need you there for it.
§7[3/20] §2Aledar: §aThat blade §athere...it's§a made for sacrifice. See how that gate is shut?
§7[4/20] §2Aledar: §aIn order to open the doors to the Outlook, we need to sacrifice a powerful soul.
§7[5/20] §2Aledar: §aIf you haven't gotten it already, the plan was to sacrifice our fourth. It's why I was hesitant about having you come along, though it was perfect.
§7[6/20] §2Aledar: §aThink about it. A soldier with no relations, no loved ones, and no way to deny their fate. But...
§7[7/20] §2Aledar: §aI've been mulling it over since we got to the town... You'll sacrifice me instead. I won't take no for an answer.
§7[9/20] §2Aledar: §aHere. You can take everything I had on me. My emeralds, and the key to the dungeon. I certainly won't be able to use them anymore.
§7[10/20] §2Aledar: §aUpon the top of the tower is... Well, something. We don't know for certain what it is, but it will prevent you from passing through.
§7[11/20] §2Aledar: §aYou'll have to kill it to break the barrier. §aBut...find§a other soldiers who can help you. It will be impossible to defeat alone.
§7[12/20] §2Aledar: §a...no§a more putting it off, then. I'm bleeding out.
§7[14/20] §2Aledar: §aNow...strike§a me down. My soul will unlock the gate...
§7[15/20] §2Aledar: §aAgh... Don't worry...a-about me...
§7[16/20] §2Aledar: §aYou...can§a do this. I know y-you can.
§7[17/20] §2Aledar: §aGah... D-Destroy it...
