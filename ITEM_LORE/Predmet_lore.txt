§8§8The very first crossbow@ 
§8in existence was claimed@ 
§8to be utterly indestructible,@ 
§8but it is only true to a@ 
§8fault. The item cannot be@ 
§8broken, but solely because@ 
§8all damage to it is instead@ 
§8reflected onto the user.@ 
§8As its age is uncountably@ 
§8ancient, wielders will find@ 
§8themselves rapidly aging@ 
§8and withering away with@ 
§8even a mere touch.@ 

§8§8Forged from the tooth@ 
§8of the fallen one, this@ 
§8spear was bargained to a@ 
§8human for his soul, not@ 
§8knowing that the weapon@ 
§8itself would claim all life.@ 

§8§8This bow, used by the@ 
§8dwarves to land the final@ 
§8blow in the slaughter of@ 
§8Garaheth is extremely powerful.@ 
§8Special, fire resistant@ 
§8gloves must be worn at all@ 
§8times to prevent burns to@ 
§8the user.@ 

§8§8Mysterious runes, held@ 
§8by inexplicable ancient@ 
§8guardians, were once moulded@ 
§8together for study purposes.@ 
§8The experiment went awry,@ 
§8as the runic words Nii,@ 
§8Az, and Ek were combined@ 
§8in a reaction that resulted@ 
§8in the collapse of a civilization.@ 

§8§8Freedom of soul, mind,@ 
§8and body are forced upon@ 
§8all those that this bow's@ 
§8arrows impact, and freedom@ 
§8of caring from the atrocities@ 
§8that such a dangerous weapon@ 
§8can inflict is given to@ 
§8all those that hold it.@ 

§8§8A relic of the past in@ 
§8Time Valley was weathered@ 
§8down to a dagger by the@ 
§8sheer power of the wind.@ 
§8When used in battle, mysterious@ 
§8intertwined wind and time@ 
§8magic give it no physical@ 
§8presence.@ 

§8§8The existence of all things@§8§8Существование всех вещей 
§8is reflected in the otherworldly@§8отражено в потусторонних 
§8jewels of this grand staff,@§8драгоценностях этого великого посоха, 
§8dense enough to have its@§8достаточно плотного, чтобы иметь 
§8own gravitational pull.@§8свое собственное гравитационное притяжение. 
§8Users have reported their@§8Использующие его сообщили, что их 
§8limbs being stretched after@§8конечности растягиваются после 
§8usage.@§8использования.

§8§8Unruly magics of void@ 
§8and darkness are tamed within@ 
§8this bow's string. While@ 
§8those energies are never@ 
§8to be released, arrows fired@ 
§8from it fire at such blinding@ 
§8speeds so as to phase out@ 
§8of existence when they hit@ 
§8their target.@ 

§8§8The last known crafts@ 
§8of Theorick before his fall@ 
§8in battle were pieces of@ 
§8armour crafted out of pure@ 
§8ice, all of which have melted@ 
§8save for these shimmering@ 
§8boots. Wearing them will@ 
§8cause one's very biology@ 
§8to change, becoming enriched@ 
§8and nurtured by sheer cold,@ 
§8while heat will only bring@ 
§8death.@ 

§8§8This wand merges with@ 
§8the user on touch, bringing@ 
§8about horrific changes to@ 
§8them. Elongated nails, sharp@ 
§8teeth and the ability to@ 
§8breathe fire are trademarks@ 
§8of the beast.@ 

§8§8Despite the light weight@ 
§8of the weapon, the spearhead@ 
§8has been made from incredibly@ 
§8dense cosmic stone. A strong@ 
§8enough impact can directly@ 
§8destroy matter. Due to this@ 
§8danger, it is sought after@ 
§8to be destroyed.@ 

§8§8Arrows fired by this bow@ 
§8are pure ice, but when they@ 
§8hit the enemy, burst into@ 
§8magical water, flash-freezing@ 
§8all that it touches. The@ 
§8frost burns will never heal.@ 

§8§8Forged with the raw powers@ 
§8of both the earth and the@ 
§8sea, these boots were initially@ 
§8an attempt at creating a@ 
§8method of foot-travel over@ 
§8the seas. Despite the spectacular@ 
§8failure of that application,@ 
§8they remain a formidable@ 
§8and reliable set of armor.@ 

§8§8Intricate carvings and@ 
§8images, almost like that@ 
§8of a totem pole, cover the@ 
§8shaft of this marvelous@ 
§8trident, dredged up from@ 
§8the Seavale Reef. Foreign@ 
§8magics heighten the senses@ 
§8of its user in battle, but@ 
§8also instills a longing@ 
§8for the ocean. Many have@ 
§8succumbed to this urge and@ 
§8drowned themselves.@ 

§8§8Despite the existence@ 
§8of the Nether Portal, few@ 
§8believe that it is possible@ 
§8to open such rifts with@ 
§8sheer force alone. None@ 
§8believe that a tool with@ 
§8enough power to accomplish@ 
§8such a monumental feat could@ 
§8exist. And yet...@ 

§8§8A vow of protection hangs@ 
§8over this spear, now inhabited@ 
§8by the spirit of a legendary@ 
§8heroine. Even simply a glimpse@ 
§8of the burning blade will@ 
§8instill a feeling of protection@ 
§8and security, and that feeling@ 
§8will hold true if one is@ 
§8brave enough to wield it.@ 

§8§8Wealth and riches...but@ 
§8at what cost?@ 

§8§8Many artifacts are found@ 
§8to incite rage in the wearer,@ 
§8and wizards old and new@ 
§8alike conjecture as to the@ 
§8purpose of them. Very few@ 
§8increase the latent abilities@ 
§8of the wearers to ensure@ 
§8havoc, and none to such@ 
§8a degree as these boots.@

§8§8Spiritual enlightenment@ 
§8is a goal that many monks@ 
§8hope to one day grasp the@ 
§8barest glimpse of, often@ 
§8thought to be a goal that@ 
§8must be worked towards over@ 
§8a lifetime. Holding this@ 
§8polished, translucent blade@ 
§8will instantly induce that@ 
§8lofty state until it is@ 
§8let go.@ 

§8§8Found at the site of the@ 
§8Caritat Mansion, this simple-looking@ 
§8glove is bathed in dark@ 
§8presence. It wracks those@ 
§8who wear it with pain, and@ 
§8instills the belief that@ 
§8the only way to end the@ 
§8pain is not to remove the@ 
§8item, but to inflict that@ 
§8same torment upon all others.@

§8§8Carved directly from the@ 
§8mysterious rock that hit@

§8pure white wand glows with@ 
§8cosmic energy unknown.@ 

§8§8One of the very few physically-powerful@ 
§8artifacts of the Villagers,@ 
§8these boots were used in@ 
§8the initial crusades against@ 
§8the Green-skins, to overpower@

§8§8When the lost city of@ 
§8Sarnfic sunk beneath the@ 
§8depths, nothing but the@ 
§8bubbles of screams and this@ 
§8single wand surfaced. When@ 
§8used, you can still hear@ 
§8the towns lament.@ 

§8§8The Dernel tribes revere@ 
§8various nature deities,@ 
§8each in their own unique@ 
§8fashions. One of the most@ 
§8notable was that of a lost@ 
§8tribe, who fashioned this@ 
§8blossoming stave as tribute@ 
§8to their deity of the earth@ 
§8itself.@ 

§8§8The raw aspect of thunder,@ 
§8though claimed to be harnessed@ 
§8by a mage in a wand, has@ 
§8only been truly tamed by@ 
§8this mighty blade. Combined@ 
§8electric and life-draining@ 
§8magic intertwine and bring@ 
§8forth the truest, most frightening@ 
§8power of all Thunder.@ 

§8§8The diminutive stature@ 
§8of this item belies its@ 
§8abilities. Absorbing and@ 
§8expelling magical energy@ 
§8in precise bursts, it protects@ 
§8the user from all manner@ 
§8of attacks while punishing@ 
§8those who dare strike.@ 

§8§8Enigmatically, this weapon@ 
§8will only show itself to@ 
§8those who believe themselves@ 
§8to be worth nothing, or@ 
§8to be weak. While utilizing@ 
§8this weapon will greatly@ 
§8strengthen one's resolve,@ 
§8it will disappear when it@ 
§8is no longer needed, going@ 
§8to the next wielder.@ 

§8§8Soul-locking magic is@ 
§8one outlawed by Gavellian@ 
§8governments, only used by@ 
§8the most insidious and cruel@ 
§8of mages. One such enchantment@ 
§8looms dormant in this mundane-looking@ 
§8maul. Continued usage of@ 
§8the weapon threatens to@ 
§8release it upon the wielder,@ 
§8permanently binding them@ 
§8to the weapon.@ 

§8§8The unwieldy, yet imposing@ 
§8stature of this massive@ 
§8sickle strikes awe into@ 
§8those who view it. Those@ 
§8who have the will to wield@ 
§8it, however, seem to garner@ 
§8respect from all those around@

§8in the right hands. It is@ 
§8told to allow the user to@

§8vulnerable to hard hitting@ 
§8attacks.@ 

§8§8A brilliant relic supposedly@ 
§8originating from the Realm@

§8are completely unknown.@ 

§8§8The runic message carved@

§8translated seems to describe@ 
§8a disaster soon to arrive@

§8§8The Blue Mask's physical@ 
§8traits are equal to that@

§8The mask is thought to originate@ 
§8from an ancient Dernel tribe.@ 

§8§8The wear upon this broken@

§8trident apparently holds@

§8§8Wearing this deceptively@ 
§8simple shroud causes the@

§8§8The cloth wraps produced@

§8§8All those who wear these@

§8§8The holy blade of the@ 
§8House of Talor was crafted@

§8eternally with the mark@ 
§8of Rodoroc's elite.@ 
§8§8The oddly uncomfortable@ 
§8helmet was hand sculpted@ 
§8from a mystic clay found@ 
§8only in the depths of Molten@ 
§8Heights. Not much is known@ 
§8about the substance.@ 

§8§8There have been many attempts@ 
§8to create a reliable power@ 
§8system in Llevigar, and@ 
§8this plasma-charged helmet@ 
§8was reforged from a notable@ 
§8prototype.@ 

§8§8The ancient bones of the@ 
§8demon Garaheth are stronger@ 
§8than steel. They clamp down@ 
§8when worn to constrict the@ 
§8bearer, inciting a slow@ 
§8madness.@ 

§8§8Discipline and experience@ 
§8is channeled into these@ 
§8wands for 10 years in the@ 
§8Bantisu monastery of the@ 
§8canyon, in the hope that@ 
§8they will pass on its teachings@ 
§8to less experienced users.@ 

§8§8The blind prophet who@ 
§8crafted this macabre breastplate@

§8are supposedly destined@ 
§8to only die either a heroic@

§8§8Andesite is a stone commonly@ 
§8used for weapons and construction,@ 
§8but tends to be ineffective@ 
§8as armor when impure. This@ 
§8sturdy chestplate, however,@ 
§8is testament to the strength@ 
§8of pure andesite.@ 

§8§8This strange pendant has@ 
§8been known to dilate time@ 
§8around the wearer, slowing@ 
§8their movements while greatly@ 
§8augmenting their power.@ 

§8§8This plain-looking silver@ 
§8bracer is one of the last@ 
§8surviving heirlooms of the@ 
§8first Gavelian king, to@ 
§8be passed down to his heirs.@ 
§8The shimmering metal is@ 
§8said to contain Remikas'@ 
§8soul within it.@ 

§8§8Although not truly magical@ 
§8by any means, the sheer@ 
§8craftsmanship of this ornate@ 
§8broach makes its wearers@ 
§8feel skillful.@ 

§8§8It is cold to the touch@ 
§8until worn. Once donned,@ 
§8it engulfs the wearer in@ 
§8excruciatingly hot flames,@ 
§8but never shall the wearer@ 
§8burn; only their enemies@ 
§8will feel the pain of the@

§8§8One of the most unstable@ 
§8wands known to man, using@ 
§8the bark of the Flerisi@ 
§8trunk it reaps firey destruction@

§8A ring used in mastering of Water@

§8Smells like glittery fish...@ 
§8bow was whittled by a cryptid-researching@ 
§8fanatic. Its frame was cut@ 
§8from the very toughest tree@ 
§8roots.@ 

§8§8The silver looks rather@ 
§8tarnished...does he expect@ 
§8you to believe that "gem"@ 
§8isn't just a cheap glass@ 
§8bauble?@ 

§8§8Despite being only an@ 
§8impure scrap of the normally@ 
§8sturdy blackiron, these@ 
§8heavy leggings still have@ 
§8extreme defensive capabilities.@ 

§8§8This golden staff was@ 
§8recovered from deep within@ 
§8the tombs of Almuj. Nothing@ 
§8else was found in the room@ 
§8except the words 'Beware@ 
§8the user with unlimited@ 
§8imagination'.@ 

§8§8The wielders of this cursed@ 
§8glassen bauble are rendered@ 
§8mute. The effect is reversed@ 
§8after the item is removed,@ 
§8but the longer it is worn,@ 
§8the longer the curse remains.@ 
§8§8Found on the corpse of@ 
§8the oldest shopkeeper of@

§8§8Often, the leader of brute@

§8§8This knife does not belong@

§8§8Found in the middle of@

§8suggest they were the handiwork@ 
§8of a wicked necromancer,@ 
§8though the truth is not@ 
§8known.@ 

§8§8The reigning king of thieves@ 
§8in Almuj’s underworld would@ 
§8brandish this golden dagger@ 
§8to his enemies so fast,@ 
§8you wouldn’t even realise@ 
§8your wallet was now missing.@ 

§8§8There used to be a constant@ 
§8battle between Almuj's thieves@

§8one day they were stolen@ 
§8by an unknown pickpocket@

§8§8Used for endurance training@

§8bow forces the wielder's@ 
§8body temperature to drop@ 
§8to near-hypothermic levels.@ 

§8§8Every time this spear@ 
§8hits an enemy, a sharp electrical@ 
§8jolt hits the users hands@ 
§8that forces powerful lightning@ 
§8to release.@ 

§8§8Although the warlock's@ 
§8curse placed upon this simple,@ 
§8Olux-crafted charm will@ 
§8reduce the abilities of@ 
§8the wearer significantly,@ 
§8its original luck-bolstering@ 
§8properties still are in@ 
§8place.@ 

§8§8The blazing sun has been@ 
§8revered by many druidic@ 
§8sects as a god in its own@ 
§8right, and the jewel in@ 
§8this brilliant wand glows@ 
§8with the brightness of their@ 
§8holy star.@ 

§8§8These pure, snow-white@ 
§8leggings are rumored to@ 
§8have been crafted by the@ 
§8legendary ice mage Theorick.@ 

§8The people of Nesaak view@ 
§8them as cursed, seeking@ 
§8to destroy them in a bid@ 
§8to stop the endless winter@

§8§8This ancient Elven sacrificial@

§8§8Once cursed by a druid@

§8away by a greedy Villager,@ 
§8it was then purified and@ 
§8mass-produced for sale as@

§8disappointment.@ 

§8§8This expertly crafted@ 
§8§8No one expected the WynnExcavation@ 
§8volcanic site to produce@ 
§8any valuable materials,@ 
§8but this heavy, obsidian-blend@ 
§8bow silenced the critics.@

§8the purest water from the@ 
§8swamp.@ 

§8spear was forged by a cryptid-researching@ 
§8fanatic. It shines brilliantly@ 
§8in even the weakest sunlight.@ 

§8§8Skien's trust in others@ 
§8was shattered permanently@ 
§8by the wielder of this dagger,@ 
§8who fell to the corruption@ 
§8and attacked his legion@ 
§8during a great corrupted@ 
§8siege.@ 

§8§8Used by the Temple of@ 
§8the Legends' strongest guard,@ 
§8the shielded plating is@ 
§8enchanted with a powerful@ 
§8ward to stave off the effects@ 
§8of the corruption.@ 
§8§8A recently married man@ 
§8went off to war wearing@ 
§8this wedding ring. Though@

§8§8The powerful psychic energies@ 
§8surrounding this bow are@ 
§8rumored to increase accuracy,@ 
§8though this has not been@ 
§8refuted by any reliable@ 
§8source.@ 

§8§8A psychopath claiming@ 
§8herself to be Death incarnate@ 
§8used this dark-bladed scythe@ 
§8on a killing spree that@ 
§8lasted over a year. It reaped@ 
§8hundreds of lives, including@ 
§8her own.@ 

§8§8Adamantite is a soft metal@ 
§8often added to exotic medicine@

§8but a revolutionary blacksmith@ 
§8on Black Road, created a@ 
§8chestplate with an Adamantite@ 
§8alloy, which is advertised@ 
§8to bolster the users endurance.@ 
§8§8Those who have used this@ 
§8near-weightless bow all@ 
§8seem to tell tales of how@ 
§8they see Gale's spirit fighting@ 
§8alongside them.@ 

§8§8Bending the fabric of@ 
§8reality to allow the wearer@ 
§8to take massive strides,@ 
§8these boots are rumored@ 
§8to contain rogue djinni@

§8§8The magical oddity known@ 
§8as lodestone has been studied@ 
§8for years as an active counterpart@ 
§8to quartz's passive magical@ 
§8properties. Research continues,@ 
§8but it is valuable when@ 
§8creating magical items.@ 

§8§8A grave digger uncovered@ 
§8this blade from the resting@ 
§8place of a notorious pirate@ 
§8that pillaged the islands@ 
§8of the ocean for four decades.@ 

§8§8This ill-fitting, bulky@ 
§8chestplate was never intended@ 
§8to be a chestplate at all.@ 
§8Rather, it is a broken fragment@ 
§8of an arm bracer, from the@ 
§8time of giants.@ 

§8§8True to their promise,@ 
§8these goggles were left@ 
§8as a memento for Ohms when@ 
§8his lover Gale finally died.@ 

§8Light as air, Gale's carefree@ 
§8nature lends itself to those@ 
§8who don them.@ 

§8§8Well...it is a very pretty-looking@ 
§8stick, but aside from that@ 
§8it just appears to be a@ 
§8plain old stick.@ 

§8§8Tisaun, a warrior tasked@ 
§8to fend off a corrupted@ 
§8siege alone, could find@ 
§8only a thin shirt and rusted@ 
§8spear to use before the@ 
§8attack. He defeated all@ 
§81000 enemies without taking@ 
§8a scratch, and his bravery@ 
§8infused his gear with that@ 
§8same strength.@ 

§8§8Once a contract is formed,@ 
§8and before its details are@ 
§8discussed, a seal is placed@ 
§8on the human's body.@ 

§8§8The unstable power within@ 
§8this bow is capable of great@ 
§8destruction, but seems to@ 
§8zero out at the most crucial@ 
§8moments in battle. Only@ 
§8the most skillful archers@ 
§8can wield this weapon with@ 
§8confidence.@ 

§8§8Forged from mystic, previously@ 
§8unknown metals revealed@ 
§8in the deepest dwarven mining@ 
§8site to date, these sleek,@ 
§8glowing greaves are believed@ 
§8to be utterly indestructible.@ 

§8§8Named for an ancient Wynnic@ 
§8word for "Earthquake", this@ 
§8mighty battle hammer causes@ 
§8the very bones of struck@ 
§8enemies to rattle and heave@ 
§8as though the earth itself@ 
§8was splitting under their@ 
§8feet.@ 

§8§8This enigmatic weapon@ 
§8can suddenly blink out of@ 
§8reality with no warning@ 
§8only to appear exactly where@ 
§8it was left later. Artificers@ 
§8have determined that almost@ 
§8the entire bow, by all known@ 
§8laws of nature and magic,@ 
§8should not exist.@ 

§8§8This spear is bright enough@ 
§8that it can cause blindness@ 
§8if you look directly at@ 
§8it. Its immense power is@ 
§8limited by its weight; the@ 
§8weapon is nearly impossible@ 
§8to lift.@ 

§8§8This matted tangle of@ 
§8vines and marshland plants@ 
§8contains various herbal@ 
§8remedies woven into it.@ 
§8It is oddly comfortable,@ 
§8despite the thorns coating@ 
§8the inside.@ 

§8§8A condition of severely@ 
§8deficient supply of oxygen@ 
§8to the body that arises@ 
§8from abnormal breathing;@ 
§8practitioners that abuse@ 
§8specific magic combos are@ 
§8often found incapacitated@ 
§8by said condition.@ 

§8§8A rogue inventor stole@ 
§8the plans for a steam jet@ 
§8booster from Corkus and@ 
§8reverse engineered them@ 
§8onto a set of boots. While@ 
§8effective, they are dangerous,@ 
§8prone to catastrophic failure.@ 

§8§8Potentially one of the@ 
§8most dangerous weapons in@ 
§8existence. A precise enough@ 
§8shot can destroy the soul@ 
§8of those it hits.@ 

§8§8The carapace of the common@ 
§8Maexi pet fire scarabs,@ 
§8while alone, only cause@ 
§8minor burns to the touch.@ 
§8However, when woven together,@ 
§8they produce a variety of@ 
§8cumulative effects.@ 

§8§8Built by Cerid to accrue@ 
§8raw static charge from the@ 
§8surroundings and direct@ 
§8it at opponents, the blade's@ 
§8chief failing is that the@ 
§8wielder is not rendered@ 
§8immune to their own discharge@ 
§8as intended.@ 

§8§8Donning this helmet sears@ 
§8your mind with images of@ 
§8a world on fire. These blistering@ 
§8thoughts pressure you to@ 
§8make that world a reality.@ 

§8A ring used in learning the basics@ 
§8of Water Magic@ 

§8Scroll of Truth often provides@ 
§8true but hurtful facts. With@ 
§8that, anyone opening it gains@ 
§8immense knowledge about@ 
§8something truthful but@ 
§8hurtful that they didn't know.@ 

§8The defeat of Bak'al was an honour@ 
§8for Bob. The whole of Wynn@ 
§8Province celebrated this@ 
§8heroic act. His knowledge is@ 
§8kept in a scroll for new@ 
§8warriors to learn.@ 

§8Found in an ancient Dogun@ 
§8library. This scroll once@ 
§8made the dogun race@ 
§8invincible in terms of damage,@ 
§8but since it's torn, it lost its@ 
§8effectiveness@ 

§8A bracelet used in learning the basics@ 

§8This brilliant chestpiece was carved@ 
§8out of pure crystalline@ 
§8marble. It brings great@ 
§8protection at a small cost of@ 
§8Dozens of tiny spikes cover the@ 
§8surface of this helmet,@ 
§8however its inside is fitted@ 
§8with very comfortable@ 
§8material.@ 

§8§8The stellar quality of@ 
§8the coral jewels set into@ 
§8the ring comes from a magical@ 
§8purification process, involving@ 
§8a decade-long soak in mystical@ 
§8Gylia water.@ 

§8§8Reconstructed from mere@ 
§8wooden scraps of its former@ 
§8self, this extremely heavy@ 
§8crossbow still contains@ 
§8immense power. It was intended@ 
§8for use with a lost suit@ 
§8of armor, of which only@ 
§8one piece remains.@ 

§8§8This wand is capable of@ 
§8attacks so fast that it@ 
§8appears to flicker in and@ 
§8out of existence. Anyone@ 
§8able to access its full@ 
§8potential will be seen as@ 
§8only a blur to their enemies.@ 

§8§8This staff was expertly@ 
§8crafted from fragile spun@ 
§8glass, and tinted with various@ 
§8magical foci that bend light@ 
§8into its most raw components.@ 

§8§8Two iron horns adorn this@ 
§8helmet to enhance the warriors@ 
§8of the Eradian, Dwarves@ 
§8who specifically rode Rams@ 
§8into battle at incredible@ 
§8speed.@ 

§8§8The two mesa tribes once@ 
§8were allies until their@ 
§8sacred totems were stolen.@ 
§8Before that time, however,@ 
§8they often shared their@ 
§8talents, and this bow hewn@ 
§8from mesa stone was one@ 
§8such lost craft.@ 

§8§8Found in a mystically-charged@ 
§8Giant ruin, these snug boots@ 
§8recall fond memories, incite@ 
§8calmness, and provide comfort@ 
§8for the wearer.@ 

§8§8An exclusive amulet given@ 
§8to the most honored knights@ 
§8of Wynn. It crackles with@ 
§8a chaotic energy.@ 

§8§8Ancient magicks are required@ 
§8to make these brilliant@ 
§8glasses, imbued with charity@ 
§8and selflessness. They allow@ 
§8sight beyond sight, rumoured@ 
§8to allow sight of a brilliant@ 
§8realm.@ 
§8§8A mystical sapling native@ 
§8to the shores of Mage Island@ 
§8has been fashioned into@ 
§8this simple staff. Even@ 
§8uprooted, you notice its@ 
§8continuous growth.@ 

§8§8This indestructible dagger@ 
§8was found floating in the@ 
§8magma of the Molten Heights,@ 
§8with a lament from its exiled@ 
§8smith carved onto the hilt.@ 

§8§8Lost by master sailor@ 
§8Carvel in a massive storm,@ 
§8it was carried all the way@ 
§8out to the city of Selchar,@ 
§8where it was found spewing@ 
§8seafoam and lightning bolts.@ 

§8§8"If anyone finds this,@ 
§8leave it at my Gale's gravesite.@ 
§8I promised her a memento,@ 
§8too." This inscription is@ 
§8extremely weathered.@ 

§8§8Stories say that should@ 
§8anyone wield both of these@ 
§8fearsome gauntlets in battle,@ 
§8they will become unkillable@ 
§8in a fight. The second gauntlet,@ 
§8however, has never been@ 
§8found.@ 

§8§8Cosmic energy permeates@ 
§8this deceptively dull-looking@ 
§8chestplate, having been@ 
§8crafted with stardust from@ 
§8a comet that only passes@ 
§8over Wynn every 1000 years.@ 

§8§8The one true Chimera in@ 
§8existence is sought by many,@ 
§8for great stories are told@ 
§8of its gifts to the worthy.@ 
§8One such gift was a simple@ 
§8fur coat, which gave the@ 
§8wearer but a taste of its@ 
§8power.@ 

§8§8A powerful mental curse@ 
§8surrounds these boots, inciting@ 
§8uncontrollable rage into@ 
§8the wearers, as well as@ 
§8the power to enact it upon@ 
§8others.@ 

§8§8Plated with enchanted@ 
§8metals, these magic-warding@ 
§8boots allow faster travel@ 
§8over nearly any solid surface.@ 

§8§8Many old mages had to@ 
§8perform lengthy incantations@ 
§8to make potent even their@ 
§8simplest spells. A mage@ 
§8cursed to be mute, however,@ 
§8brought upon a revolution@ 
§8to spellcasting through@ 
§8this simple wand.@ 

§8§8Despite this mace never@ 
§8seeing use by Remikas, it@ 
§8was seen as a symbol of@ 
§8the might of his rule over@ 
§8Gavel. Its true abilities@ 
§8in battle have never been@ 
§8seen.@ 

§8§8Supposedly based off of@ 
§8the wand of master mage@ 
§8Ethe, this wand is plated@ 
§8with magic-focusing jewels@ 
§8and heavy gold, yet somehow@ 
§8remains entirely weightless.@ 

§8§8This peculiar shawl is@ 
§8eternally warm to the touch,@ 
§8and shimmers brilliantly@ 
§8in the sunlight. It is rumored@ 
§8to give amazing health benefits@ 
§8and good fortune to those@ 
§8who wear it.@ 

§8§8It is thought that this@ 
§8primitive wand was used@ 
§8by early man to create the@ 
§8first spells. It is made@ 
§8from a wood that no longer@ 
§8exists.@ 

§8§8This golden cuff has an@ 
§8odd time dilation effect@ 
§8surrounding it, slowing@ 
§8all movements significantly,@ 
§8but multiplying the force@ 
§8of impact to a significant@ 
§8degree.@ 

§8§8This dark relic was found@ 
§8at the very bottom of the@ 
§8deepest trench of the ocean.@ 
§8It drains all light surrounding@ 
§8it, blinding everything@ 
§8in a strange abyssal darkness.@ 
§8§8Aldorei charms are often@ 
§8shared and tinkered with@ 
§8by gifted Elves within the@ 
§8commune. Though simple,@ 
§8the stones blessed by elven@ 
§8magic provide soothing energy@ 
§8to the wearer.@ 

§8§8During a spiritual journey@ 
§8to Kato temple, the sage@ 
§8Capian was presented with@ 
§8powerful spiritual boots@ 
§8with the intention to be@ 
§8used for peaceful magic,@ 
§8and not hard combat.@ 

§8Uth runes and sheer rage@ 
§8intertwine to create a fearsome@ 
§8sight, as this weapon is@ 
§8total destruction.@ 

§8§8The dark spectres of the@ 
§8decayed forests have created@ 
§8an insidious helmet to drain@ 
§8the spirit of those who@ 
§8wear it, and become servants@ 
§8to their dark whims. Many@ 
§8have fallen to its allure.@ 

§8§8This bow's thick string@ 
§8fails to shoot arrows effectively,@ 
§8but instead produces low@ 
§8frequency sound waves that@ 
§8erupt from the source in@ 
§8all directions. The sound@ 
§8can implode the eardrums@ 
§8of an enemy with a single@ 
§8strum.@ 

§8§8These ancient, spark-coursing@ 
§8greaves are all that remains@ 
§8of the great thunder mage@ 
§8Ohms' favorite golem familiar@ 
§8after a dark force turned@ 
§8it against its masters.@ 

§8§8Materials of all sorts@ 
§8have been lashed together@ 
§8in this crude, blocky set@ 
§8of leggings. From darksteel@ 
§8to leather to rotting wood,@ 
§8each part is a perfect square.@ 
§8It has, so far, been impossible@ 
§8to recreate.@ 

§8§8Worn by a terrible berserker@ 
§8during his fanatical rampage@ 
§8through the land, his rage@ 
§8permeates this horned blackiron@ 
§8helmet.@ 

§8§8The thick, Bovemist-sanctified@ 
§8cloth is worn by their priests@ 
§8during certain religious@ 
§8ceremonies. It clears the@ 
§8mind and purifies the body.@ 

§8of Wynn. It shines with@ 
§8a powerful strength.@ 
§8of Wynn. It glows with a@ 
§8comforting warmth.@ 
§8of Wynn. It whistles with@ 
§8an invigorating tune.@ 

§8dagger was smithed by a@ 
§8cryptid-researching fanatic.@ 
§8It can chop through even@ 
§8the thickest of the swamp's@ 
§8clay with ease.@ 

§8§8This short spear was the@ 
§8first weapon to be produced@ 
§8by the villagers for sale.@ 
§8They are old, but strong.@ 

§8§8The mystery of the ocean’s@ 
§8appearance has eluded scholars@ 
§8for centuries. It is believed@ 
§8that many years ago, warlocks@ 
§8used wands like this one@ 
§8in an attempt to submerge@ 
§8the world.@ 

§8§8This ancient stone-hewn@ 
§8helmet is blended with the@ 
§8bones of an extinct animal@ 
§8of some kind. It is harder@ 
§8than dragon's hide.@ 

§8§8Despite being a much smaller@ 
§8settlement compared to the@ 
§8mighty citadel of Rodoroc,@ 
§8the dwarven smiths of Thanos@ 
§8still can forge mighty products,@ 
§8such as these heavy diamond-alloy@ 
§8boots.@ 

§8§8Originating from the unspeakable@ 
§8dark land, looking into@ 
§8the helmet will show nothing@ 
§8but darkness. Wearing it@ 
§8is said to reverse your@ 
§8morality, as if it were@ 
§8draining your will to live@ 
§8into the void.@ 

§8§8Torn scraps of metal line@ 
§8the inside of these boots.@ 
§8They provide no protection,@ 
§8instead forcing a constant@ 
§8adrenaline rush while worn.@ 

§8§8This dagger has no blade.@ 
§8Instead, it is layered with@ 
§8the stingers of the Black@ 
§8Shadow Scorpion, which has@ 
§8the ability to vanish entirely@ 
§8from its prey.@ 

§8§8Prolonged exposure to@ 
§8the corruption may cause@ 
§8sudden bursts of madness@ 
§8in soldiers. To assure themselves@ 
§8of their sanity, some have@ 
§8even begun to play tricks@ 
§8on their brethren.@ 

§8§8Occasional whisperings@ 
§8can be heard by the wearers@ 
§8of this stone mask, reforged@ 
§8from a phylactery of souls.@ 
§8Although not dangerous,@ 
§8staring into the eyes of@ 
§8the mask can bring fear@ 
§8of one's soul being trapped@ 
§8within.@ 

§8A mysterious magic infused fruit had@ 
§8been discovered deep within@ 
§8the Dernel Jungle. Ingesting@ 
§8the juice from this fruit@ 
§8brings incrediable luck and@ 
§8fortune for a short amount@ 
§8of time.@ 

§8§8Fashioned from the cut@ 
§8tails of the now extinct@ 
§8Venti, these nearly immaterial@ 
§8boots are light as air and@ 
§8crackle with lightning.@ 

§8§8If you reach for ammunition@ 
§8from your quiver, as long@ 
§8as you have a single arrow,@ 
§8you will find you never@ 
§8run out.@ 

§8§8Although these boots are@ 
§8crafted from corrupted stone,@ 
§8they do not exhibit any@ 
§8corruptive effects on their@ 
§8wearers. Speculation abounds@ 
§8as to the reason.@ 

§8§8Many said making a bow@ 
§8out of iron would be slow@ 
§8and wasteful, but the weight@ 
§8of the iron arrow can pierce@ 
§8even stone.@ 

§8§8One of Detlas’ founding@ 
§8buildings was struck by@ 
§8lightning 60 years ago and@ 
§8burnt to the ground, apart@ 
§8from one wooden beam that@ 
§8began to glow. It was fashioned@ 
§8into an exclusive wand for@ 
§8resident mages.@ 

§8§8These boots were retrieved@ 
§8from a frozen man, uncovered@ 
§8on an expedition to Mt.@ 
§8Wynn. It is believed that@ 
§8the man had been wandering@ 
§8the world before his death.@ 

§8§8The blade seems sharper@ 
§8than normal, but it also@ 
§8seems rather brittle. The@ 
§8smithing was obviously a@ 
§8hack-job...@ 

§8§8It is significantly heavier@ 
§8than usual...you can't tell@ 
§8if that is good or not,@ 
§8in this case.@ 

§8§8It seems stronger at first@ 
§8glance, but upon closer@ 
§8inspection the blade is@ 
§8rather...soft?@ 

§8§8The magic in this wand@ 
§8seems much weaker than normal...and@ 
§8there's a rather rude message@ 
§8written on the handle.@ 

§8§8The craftsmanship on this@ 
§8bow is rather poor. The@ 
§8paint on the "crystals"@ 
§8is chipping...@ 

§8§8The merchant insists that@ 
§8the wear and oxidation on@ 
§8the armor "is a feature."@ 

§8§8Aside from the added plating,@ 
§8they look more or less intact.@ 
§8Somehow, that doesn't surprise@ 
§8you.@ 

§8§8They look extremely bulky@ 
§8and uncomfortable...do they@ 
§8have a right to call it@ 
§8"enhanced"?@ 

§8§8Even ignoring the numerous@ 
§8scorches all over, these@ 
§8boots hardly look any better.@ 

§8of Wynn. It pulsates with@ 
§8a calming aura.@ 

§8§8Due to an unfortunate@ 
§8accident where he choked@ 
§8on a lemon, an unremarkable@ 
§8mercenary became a laughing@ 
§8stock. He later managed@ 
§8to shed the title, as he@ 
§8left no one alive who remembered@ 
§8the name.@ 

§8§8Forged from unbreakable@ 
§8obsidian eras ago, this@ 
§8heavy hammer has crushed@ 
§8many foes with a single@ 
§8swing.@ 

§8§8Being one of the absolute@ 
§8rarest treasures in the@ 
§8world, it seems to have@ 
§8a mind of its own, only@ 
§8showing itself when a stroke@ 
§8of luck is had.@ 

§8§8This battered chestplate@ 
§8was once worn by the legendary@ 
§8Wynnic protector, Bob, during@ 
§8the fearsome corrupted sieges@ 
§8before he gave it away to@ 
§8an old friend. An air of@ 
§8melancholy hangs over it.@ 

§8§8Rumored to be crafted@ 
§8from a Dernic stone, these@ 
§8sinister boots radiate extremely@ 
§8powerful dark energy. They@ 
§8have absorbed the power@ 
§8of the raging seas in their@ 
§8time locked in Sarnfic.@ 

§8§8Carried by the Olux Plague@ 
§8Doctor, this simple-looking@ 
§8stick subtly oozes with@ 
§8an unidentifiable substance@ 
§8that is invigorating to@ 
§8the holder, and lethally@ 
§8venomous to anything else.@ 

§8§8There are little chips@ 
§8and cracks all over this...@ 
§8was someone trying to break@ 
§8it down for gold?@ 

§8§8It looks like someone@ 
§8tried and failed to improve@ 
§8it. The re-smithing job@ 
§8was obviously rushed...@ 

§8§8It looks more like a dog@ 
§8paw to you, but you don't@ 
§8feel like risking your life@ 
§8arguing with the merchant.@ 

§8§8The average bow can boast@ 
§8a range of skills, but unlike@ 
§8this one, not every bow@ 
§8can penetrate through any@ 
§8organic skin, including@ 
§8dragon hide.@ 

§8§8This helmet was worn long@ 
§8ago by an infamous assassin@ 
§8who plagued Bovemist sites@ 
§8for decades. It was crafted@ 
§8of the still-bloody skin@ 
§8of their most prized and@ 
§8worshiped cows.@ 

§8§8Crafted from Mandragora@ 
§8roots and adorned with decorative@ 
§8wreaths of Elven pines,@ 
§8these wands are utilized@ 
§8in Efilim's solstice festivals@ 
§8to celebrate each passing@ 
§8year of Villager and Elven@ 
§8comradery.@ 

§8§8A strange magic attracts@ 
§8you to this ring. Maybe@ 
§8you shouldn't tell anyone@ 
§8about its existence?@ 

§8§8This bow has no string.@ 
§8Instead, a thin lightning-like@ 
§8thread is strung upon it.@ 
§8It is said to be limited@ 
§8only by the speed of the@ 
§8user.@ 

§8§8Only the most honourable@ 
§8warriors of Gavel's army@ 
§8are presented the trident@ 
§8shaped spear, forged from@ 
§8the rarest metal from the@ 
§8molten heights.@ 

§8§8Despite appearing as a@ 
§8basic blade when held, strange@ 
§8spiritual magic changes@ 
§8its form into a sharp, ring-like@ 
§8cutting edge when used to@ 
§8attack. Only one person@ 
§8was known to master the@ 
§8weapon's abilities.@ 

§8§8Wielded by the master@ 
§8of the Decrepit Sewers Dungeon,@ 
§8the arrows of this bow causes@ 
§8the target's body to slowly@ 
§8wither away.@ 
§8§8The Elves managed to harness@ 
§8the power of air itself,@ 
§8forming a bow made entirely@ 
§8of air currents, allowing@ 
§8the user to move swift like@ 
§8the wind, but vulnerable@ 
§8to attacks.@ 
§8§8Elementally attuned gemstones@ 
§8are melded together to form@ 
§8the singular marvel found@ 
§8on this pendant. Despite@ 
§8the violent smithing process,@ 
§8the jewel is utterly flawless.@ 

§8§8Once having held unstoppable@ 
§8amounts of magic, being@ 
§8forced to fuse into one@ 
§8form locked away all but@ 
§8the smallest sliver of their@ 

§8§8Brilliantly golden as@ 
§8the crops from the humble@ 
§8farm, its mere presence@ 
§8fills stomachs and brings@ 
§8comfort, but only to those@ 
§8who are modest and generous.@ 
§8§8Wielding it for too long@ 
§8will leave one a dessicated@ 
§8husk, as this dull blade@ 
§8slowly absorbs all liquids@ 
§8around it.@ 

§8§8...As the heart fails,@ 
§8adrenaline pumps through@ 
§8the body in an attempt to@ 
§8provide energy and keep@ 
§8the victim alive, but medical@ 
§8action must be taken to@ 
§8ensure survival. -Excerpt@

§8§8These leggings are the@ 
§8last remaining piece of@ 
§8a historical set of armor,@ 
§8created with such power@ 
§8as to be thought impossible@ 
§8long ago.@ 

§8§8A mighty, earth-shatteringly@ 
§8powerful weapon was destroyed@ 
§8for fear of its raw power,@ 
§8and the pieces buried. They@ 
§8were unearthed decades later,@ 
§8and were reforged into various@ 
§8items including this sturdy@ 
§8bracer.@ 

§8Reverberating with the bravery@ 
§8and residual strength of@ 
§8fallen Wynn soldiers, every@ 
§8casualty only serves to@ 
§8harden the resolve it instills@ 
§8in the wearer.@ 

§8§8An old Nemract saying@ 
§8is engraved along the metal.@ 
§8"A single toss of the knucklebones@ 
§8can make or break a gambling@ 
§8man."@ 

§8§8Power, but at what cost?@ 

§8§8Many have tried to duplicate@ 
§8the properties of this spear,@ 
§8but very few have succeeded@ 
§8in enchanting a spearhead@ 
§8with explosive magic that@ 
§8does not cause the spear@ 
§8itself to explode.@ 

§8§8A centuries-old storm@ 
§8spirit was banished to these@ 
§8tight boots for his destructive@ 
§8actions. His fury empowers@ 
§8those who wear them with@ 
§8the great force of a raging@ 
§8cyclone.@ 

§8§8The wear on this humble@ 
§8war pick's blade has only@ 
§8made it more effective in@ 
§8combat, allowing its users@ 
§8to make unexpected parries@ 
§8of opponents' attacks by@ 
§8hooking and hitting through@ 
§8the weapon.@ 

§8§8This blackiron blade was@ 
§8left to sear in the desert@ 
§8for months on end by a fanatical@ 
§8berserker. It burned him@ 
§8alive as he cut down those@ 
§8who opposed him.@ 

§8§8Forged on Mage Island,@ 
§8the sparkling liquid-like@ 
§8armour is as hard as obsidian,@ 
§8but light and fluid as water.@ 
§8It glistens with the magic@ 
§8of the ocean winds.@ 

§8§8These bulky-looking gauntlets@ 
§8are actually extremely lightweight,@ 
§8being created of a magical@ 
§8elf-blessed iron alloy blend.@ 

§8§8The art of endurance fighting@ 
§8is a skill lost to time.@ 
§8However, a thief that to@ 
§8this day has not been caught,@ 
§8imbued this dagger with@ 
§8the very same ability.@ 

§8§8A year-long monsoon soaked@ 
§8this Nemract-made bow so@ 
§8much, that it has harnessed@ 
§8the very essence of water.@ 

§8§8The density of this weapon@ 
§8is almost immeasurable.@ 
§8Despite being light and@ 
§8easy to wield, the spear@ 
§8seems to have its own gravitational@ 
§8pull, slowly dragging enemies@ 
§8closer and making it nearly@ 
§8impossible to put down.@ 

§8§8Forged directly from the@ 
§8bloody red stone mined from@ 
§8the Nether, they were locked@ 
§8away for fear of inciting@ 
§8insanity in those who wore@ 
§8them.@ 

§8§8Long strips of chitin@ 
§8discarded from the mother@ 
§8of spiders Arakadicus still@ 
§8contain traces of her wicked@ 
§8powers, but few have survived@ 
§8the attempts to harvest@ 

§8§8The flickering flame atop@ 
§8this simple wand is a marvel@ 
§8of magic. It always burns@ 
§8at a comfortable heat, cannot@ 
§8scorch skin even if touched,@ 
§8and never can be snuffed@ 
§8out under any circumstance.@ 

§8§8Using an unorthodox method@ 
§8of smithing, these copper@ 
§8leggings are insulated with@ 
§8an extremely conductive@ 
§8blend of liquid to improve@ 
§8electrical discharge.@ 

§8§8Recovered from a corrupted@ 
§8soldier who wore them, it@ 
§8was found dancing instead@ 
§8of attacking those around@ 
§8it. Even after it was killed,@ 
§8it jostled and jerked around@ 
§8like a dancing puppet.@ 

§8This peculiar weapon was@ 
§8once wielded by the firey@ 
§8warrior Igbar, who used@ 
§8it to great effect in nether-endurance@ 
§8competitions.@ 

§8§8While only a mockery of@ 
§8the original product, this@ 
§8line of helmets became wildly@ 
§8popular before legal disputes@ 
§8and safety concerns halted@ 
§8production.@ 

§8§8The forger of this ring@ 
§8had to endure 30 long days@ 
§8of smelting various metals@ 
§8only found in the ocean.@ 
§8A single mistake would ruin@ 
§8the creation. The mystic@ 
§8metals are said to seep@ 
§8into the wearers skin to@ 
§8gently replenish their resolve.@ 

§8The make of this massive@ 
§8cloak is unlike anything@ 
§8seen before among the provinces.@ 
§8Foreign images shift and@ 
§8melt in ethereal projections@ 
§8within the inside.@ 

§8§8Stone shorn from mountains@ 
§8by the roiling sea gathered@ 
§8on the shores of Llevigar@ 
§8one day, washed onto the@ 
§8sand in the shape of a massive@ 
§8spear. It was taken as an@ 
§8omen, and the stones were@ 
§8forged into a true weapon.@ 

§8§8Llevigar's schools of@ 
§8wizardry are notorious for@ 
§8their difficult training@ 
§8regimens. These leg plates,@ 
§8forcing users to balance@ 
§8spellcasting with direct@ 
§8combat, are often cited@ 
§8as the tipping point for@

§8§8One of the master tinkerer@

§8§8Even simply looking at@ 
§8these odd rings gives way@ 
§8to a compulsion to wear@

§8§8These boots were standard@

§8§8Just a test item.@ 

§8§8Wielded by the chief of@

§8§8These common leather boots@ 
§8were once owned by a barbarian@ 
§8with no magical prowess,@ 
§8who, instead of enchanting@

§8§8The scholar-priest Ensa@ 
§8created this pendant as@ 
§8a personal prayer while@ 
§8his home was under siege.@ 
§8It is rumored to hold the@ 
§8key to enlightenment, but@ 
§8it is unknown as to how.@ 

§8This ring is used to learn spells@

§8§8Sealed away by the Avos@

§8This beatiful ring has a mysterious@ 
§8aura around it, with@
