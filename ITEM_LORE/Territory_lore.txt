§7A lush cavern hidden under the @

§7bursting with life and natural energies, @ 
§7and is fiercely protected... @ 

§7This egg-shaped island is home to @ 
§7a single resident, a featherbrained villager @

§7Hundreds of years ago, the original @§7
§7stone city of Nemract was ravaged @§7
§7by a swarm of the undead. @§7
§7Now it is only inhabited by @§7
§7the corpses of those who died @§7
§7that day. @§7

§7Wild ocelots inhabit this mostly-barren savannah, @ 
§7which leads to the Almuj desert. @ 
§7There is a town on the @ 
§7edge of the mountains, though few @ 
§7visit it. @ 

§7Not many travel to this little @ 
§7tribal village in the savannah, but @ 
§7it is said to be the @ 
§7home of a powerful sorcerer. @ 

§7Despite mining opening up the infamous @ 
§7portal, it did not stop. Some @ 
§7speculate that these mines are hiding @ 
§7an even greater danger... @ 

§7Founded in 970AP after the waves @ 
§7calmed, this city became the bridge @ 
§7between Gavel and Wynn. It flourishes @ 
§7in trade and enjoys a safe @ 
§7haven from the dangers of both @ 
§7provinces. @ 

§7Ocean currents flow and intertwine to @ 
§7form these renowned reefs, bursting with @ 
§7life. Tourists frequently dive and discover @ 
§7lost treasure, dropped from merchant ships @ 
§7and carried by the currents. @ 

§7A thousand years ago, a group @ 
§7of emerald miners unearthed a mysterious @ 
§7portal. Unknowingly, they doomed the province @ 
§7to centuries of war against the @ 
§7mysterious force known as corruption. @ 

§7A massive pirate ship crashed here @ 
§7with such severity, the hull was @ 
§7moulded into the cliffside. Some say @ 
§7that there is still treasure hidden @ 
§7inside. @ 

§7Even in the harsh desert, people @ 
§7have found a way to survive. @ 
§7The massive city of Almuj uses @ 
§7the nearby water sources to keep @ 
§7its city a thriving oasis. @ 

§7Despite its barren surroundings, this river @ 
§7has sprouted various plant life. It @ 
§7flows straight into the Rymek Canyon. @ 

§7WynnExcavation is a Gavel-owned company dedicated @ 
§7to uncovering the history of the @ 
§7Wynn Province. Here, they've uncovered an @ 
§7ancient tomb from a lost empire. @ 

§7Once the barracks of the Almuj @ 
§7Army, it has been taken over @ 
§7by the traitorous rebel, Commander Takan. @ 

§7Home to the reclusive mages responsible @ 
§7for calming the waves, the people @ 
§7on this island continue to study @ 
§7magic and advance their capabilities beyond @ 
§7any other. @ 

§7The town of Rymek was founded @ 
§7by the Creden Tibus bandit group. @ 
§7They only deal exchanges through a @ 
§7special currency. @

§7A twelve-volume story of Wynn's great @ 
§7hero can be found here. The @ 
§7origins of this library, and others @ 
§7like it, still remain unknown. @ 

§7In the year 854 AP (After @ 
§7Portal), a massive horde of undead @ 
§7lead by Bak’al attacked Ragni. The @ 
§7people of the city sought refuge @ 
§7in the sewer, the only safe @ 
§7place left. @ 

§7From the watch towers set up @ 
§7across the province, scouts were able @ 
§7to spot an incoming horde from @ 
§7miles away, helping to prepare for @ 
§7countless battles. @ 

§7A once great city was reduced @ 
§7to rubble in 347 AP (After @ 
§7Portal) in one of the largest @ 
§7attacks by Bak'al ever documented. There @ 
§7was only one survivor. @ 

§7Just the name of Bak'al is @ 
§7enough to make many cower in @ 
§7fear. They say that wherever he @ 
§7appears, he will only leave death @ 
§7in his wake. @ 

§7This cavern is evidence that corruption @ 
§7is like a weed. The roots @ 
§7spread throughout the province. @ 

§7The Emperor's 26th son was named @ 
§7Hashr. As he grew older, he @ 
§7became wrought with greed and envy @ 
§7of his father's power. It wasn't @ 
§7long before he was willing to @ 
§7kill. @ 

§7A village of hobbits, it is @ 
§7home to a blacksmith by the @ 
§7name of Dodegar, seeking to forge @ 
§7the ultimate weapon. @ 

§7This towering nest is the Qira @ 
§7Hive, a challenge against the powerful @ 
§7creations of the enigmatic Qira. @ 

§7Tainted by the flames, this spire @ 
§7serves as the dramatic trail up @ 
§7to the nest of the dragon @ 
§7herself, Ozoth. @ 

§7The only residence of dwarves outside @ 
§7of the Molten Heights, Thanos has @ 
§7been decimated by Ozoth, a powerful @ 
§7dragon feared across the entire province. @ 

§7Thesead is one of the smaller @ 
§7cities of Gavel, but its coal @ 
§7industry has kept it thriving. However, @ 
§7recently the coal mines have shut @ 
§7down. @ 

§7Bantisu Air Temple has served as @ 
§7a beacon in the Canyon of @ 
§7The Lost. The Air Monks help @ 
§7guide people who have gotten lost. @ 

§7The city of Eltom is the @ 
§7only human residence in Gavel. Since @ 
§7humans aren't permitted to settle in @ 
§7the province, it has remained hidden @ 
§7to outsiders. @ 

§7Reminant of the Dogun genocide, the @ 
§7Dragons sided with the native residents. @ 
§7However, the dwarves proved to be @ 
§7the dominant force beneath the lava. @ 

§7Cursed by an ice dragon's breath, @ 
§7this is a scar of the @ 
§7Dogun genocide. @ 

§7The elegant Crystal Falls decorate the @ 
§7scenery around the dojo of Sensei @ 
§7Miyagi, a wise teacher who has @ 
§7trained hundreds of apprentices. @ 

§7For which the Gylia Plains are @§7Названное в честь ближайших полей,

§7energy surrounds this place. @§7магическая энергия.

§7Home of the Gerts, a race @ 
§7of hunger fuelled orange-headed brutes. Though @ 
§7they aren't very intelligent, they are @ 
§7still a force to be reckoned @ 
§7with. @ 

§7Once a brilliant cathedral, it has @ 
§7been abandoned since most of the @ 
§7church's followers chose to worship demons @ 
§7instead. @ 

§7Devoid of color, all the souls @ 
§7of the dead will make their @ 
§7way to here, the realm of @ 
§7the dead. @ 

§7A port town filled with odd @ 
§7residents and drunken sailors, Jofash Docks @ 
§7is the only entryway to Gavel @ 
§7outside of the main gate. @ 

§7The Emperor's Sceptre is a mysterious @ 
§7artifact that gave the holder unquestionable @ 
§7power. The people of the Desert @ 
§7Empire constructed temples to honor it. @ 

§7Once a humble town, Lexdale has @ 
§7been overrun by cultists, worshipping a @ 
§7dark being named Naragath. @ 

§7A dwarven town founded as a @ 
§7monument to the victory in Molten @ 
§7Heights. It was built by the @ 
§7power of the people. Dwarves are @ 
§7communal and riches are owned by @ 
§7all. @ 

§7The volcanoes stand upon a hollow @ 
§7victory and support the few survivors @ 
§7of the war. Some argue it @ 
§7was a genocide, not a war. @ 

§7A native tribe of the Dernel @ 
§7Jungle resides here. Its people revere @ 
§7the tree in the village's center @ 
§7as their guardian. @ 

§7Only the most revered of scholars @ 
§7and adventurers are allowed inside of @

§7These barracks are where the Cinfras @

§7Maltic was the first settlement ever @ 
§7made by the arriving villagers. The @ 
§7alliance between Villagers and Humans would @ 
§7go on to save the province. @ 

§7The tiny survivor population of Doguns @ 
§7fled to the surface after the @ 
§7subterranean war. They are ill suited @ 
§7to living above ground. @ 

§7This island is home to some @ 
§7form of cult, obsessed with the @ 
§7moon and its power. Rumours fly @ 
§7about it, a common thought being @ 
§7that they are attempting to summon @

§7An arena for those who wish @

§7This massive factory, built by the @ 
§7engineer Cerid, was once hailed as @ 
§7the national monument of Corkus. Ever @ 
§7since it was closed down, it @ 
§7has fallen into disrepair. @ 

§7This massive statue is often thought @ 
§7not to be merely a still @ 
§7monument, but actually a living being. @ 

§7Home of the bird-like Avos, the @ 
§7native inhabitants of Corkus. Though they @ 
§7welcomed the Corkians initially, tensions between @ 
§7the two have grown over the @

§7This dark tunnel connects the Sky @ 
§7Islands of Gavel to the Jofash @ 
§7Docks on the province's eastern coast, @ 
§7for those who wish to go @ 
§7sailing. @ 

§7The entryway to the Molten Heights, @ 
§7a fiery den of volcanoes. It's @ 
§7the home of the Dwarves, and @ 
§7the last remaining Doguns. @ 

§7The capital of the Dwarven dominated @ 
§7Molten Heights. Carved from the rocks @ 
§7by the power of the people, @ 
§7it stands as one of the @ 
§7strongest cities ever made. @ 

§7A town built on the edge @ 
§7of a cliff, Kandon-Beda specializes in @ 
§7air travel. It also houses a @ 
§7library for those who wish to @ 
§7learn history. @ 

§7Home of the Sky Raiders, a @ 
§7group of pirates who plunder and @

§7The central city of the Sky @ 
§7Islands, Ahmsord is home to the @ 
§7wealthiest of traders, and the most @ 
§7revered of adventurers. @ 

§7Nemract was one of the cities @ 
§7attacked most often. The people would @ 
§7hide in the gutters and sewers @ 
§7until it was over. However, corrupt @ 
§7enemies are not without intelligence, and @ 
§7they were quickly discovered by the @ 
§7enemy. @ 

§7The mysteries uncovered from this excavation @ 
§7were quickly abandoned as a new @ 
§7dark force, one far more mysterious @ 
§7than corruption, was the last thing @ 
§7this province needed. @ 

§7Home of the Legendary Challenge, a @ 
§7test for those who think that @ 
§7they are the strongest in the @ 
§7world. It is named for its @ 
§7designer, the eccentric Dr. Legendary. @ 

§7Following the death of the Emperor, @ 
§7sandstorms raged across the land, and @ 
§7the Eagle Tribe was forced to @ 
§7take refuge in an abandoned prayer @ 

§7The civilization that ruled this land @ 
§7over 1000 years ago seemed to @ 
§7be equally as educated as people @ 
§7today. There are lots of texts @ 
§7dedicated to the Emperor. @ 

§7After realizing its true power, Hashr @ 
§7realized he must hide the sceptre @ 
§7where no one could find it. @ 
§7Many years later, a group of @ 
§7bandits found refuge in this very @ 
§7temple. @ 

§7When the sceptre was taken from @ 
§7its master, a curse of sandstorms @ 
§7plagued the empire for years. Nearly @ 
§7everything was buried, even the royal @ 
§7palace. @ 

§7When the Creden Tibus discovered the @ 
§7Emperor's Sceptre in an ancient, hidden @ 
§7temple, they decided to hide it @ 
§7closer to home. After many generations, @ 
§7they grew paranoid, and moved it @ 
§7once more. @ 

§7After being kicked out of the @ 
§7Wynn cities during the Corruption War, @ 
§7a growing number of bandits began @ 
§7to reassimilate in the desert and @ 
§7mesa. @ 

§7The modern city of Detlas was @ 
§7built with the help of villagers @ 
§7after their arrival in Wynn. But @ 
§7these ruins might hold the secrets @ 
§7of what lied before... @ 

§7This tunnel seems to have been @ 
§7dug out unnaturally. The groans of @ 
§7the undead echo and clash in @ 
§7the fetid cavern air. @ 

§7It seems the wizard's gravity spell @ 
§7made you fall all the way @ 
§7through space, landing on the moon @ 
§7itself. Weird. @ 

§7Attacks from the portal were often @ 
§7so brutal, it forced people underground. @ 
§7Sometimes, they never made it back @ 
§7out. @ 

§7The people who built these mysterious @ 
§7structures had unusual control over time @ 
§7magic. Very few alive understand it @ 
§7or know about the people who @ 
§7lived here, for they were neither @ 
§7Human nor Villager. A species from @ 
§7a distant land. @ 

§7This old library has been slumbering @ 
§7beneath Lusuco for years. It tells @ 
§7the story of the legendary Twain @ 
§7children. @ 

§7The proud farmers surrounding Ragni were @ 
§7often left to fend for themselves. @ 
§7They have proven to be resourceful @ 
§7and hardened. They created their own @ 
§7infrastructure, but when they were totally @ 
§7abandoned  by the army, there @ 
§7was nothing but slaughter. @ 

§7The corrupt entity known as Bak'al @ 
§7has appeared countless times since the @ 
§7portal was opened, decimating everything in @ 
§7his path. @ 

§7The Pigmen are a mysterious creature, @ 
§7neither pig nor man, neither corrupt @ 
§7nor whole. @ 

§7This ancient monument only opens to @ 
§7those it deems worthy. Inside is @ 
§7contained secrets of the Wynn Plains @ 
§7that few eyes have ever seen. @ 

§7This strange island is home to @ 
§7the province's one and only zoo. @ 
§7The owner thought out in the @ 
§7ocean the creatures would be safe @ 
§7from the corruption, but the zoo @ 
§7doesn't get many visitors. @ 

§7Oppressively dark and enigmatic, simply being @ 
§7inside this cave makes you feel @ 
§7disconnected from your body. Horrific power @ 
§7permeates the area... @ 

§7Mold, viscera, chemicals, and waste combine @ 
§7to give this laboratory a disgusting @ 
§7smell. Filth seems to cover every @ 
§7inch of this place. @ 

§7This library tells a tale that @ 
§7the government of Corkus has kept @ 
§7secret. Rumors tell that more mysterious @ 
§7libraries like this one are hidden @ 
§7across the world. @ 

§7The history of the Avos has @ 
§7remained largely unknown, but this monument @ 
§7of Avos ancestry might hold the @ 
§7ancient secrets that historians have been @ 
§7looking for. @ 

§7Long ago, the Avos hid away @ 
§7a powerful necklace. Despite the many @ 
§7tales and legends of it, it @ 
§7has never been located until now. @ 

§7A secluded gorge, rumored to be @ 
§7the territory of a notorious lone @ 
§7bandit. The stones turn a fiery @ 
§7spectrum of colors in the sunrise @ 
§7and set. @ 

§7Desperate for resources, the mining mechs@ 
§7of Corkus have begun digging to@ 
§7bedrock. The magma layers aren't far@

§7This lush, open-air cavern is home @ 
§7to a secluded pair of Avos. @ 
§7They have some kind of vendetta @ 
§7against humans... it may be best @ 
§7to leave them be. @
