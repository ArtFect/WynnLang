§8is extraordinarily magical

§8told to allow the user to

§8vulnerable to hard hitting

§8§8A brilliant relic supposedly
§8originating from the Realm

§8§8The runic message carved
§8on these enigmatic boots
§8cover hundreds of different

§8disused, but what has been
§8translated seems to describe
§8a disaster soon to arrive
§8to the world.
§8§8The Blue Mask's physical

§8The mask is thought to originate
§8from an ancient Dernel tribe.
