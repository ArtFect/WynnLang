§7    §7§oOver 1000 years ago, before the great dismantling of the Ahms region, a mighty beast roamed the land.
§7    §7§oIt was not only a beast of immense power, but also great wisdom. Many would come from far and wide to seek its counsel.
§7    §7§oHowever, after a cataclysmic event, the region shattered, and left the beast lost all hope in villager kind.
§7    §7§oFor it was the desire of riches that shook the land, and the beast could not tolerate it any longer.
§7    §7§oThe beast departed the fractured region, leaving the people with all the riches in the world, but no land to enjoy it with.
§7    §7§oHe departed this land leaving only this advice: Should the greed of this land be in reprimand, seek me out. The seeds of enlightenment should be sewn at the canyon ridge.
§7    §7§oAlthough the location of the “Ridge” has been supposedly found, no such seed has ever grown there.
§7    §7§oLeading us to believe that the Ahms region has always been fractured, and this is just a tale passed down to explain what can not be explained.

§7[6/6]§2 Trials Overseer:§a Ladies, you may now… Begin!
§7[1/4]§2 Trials Overseer:§a That weeded out the weak. Every queen must be strong to lead.
§7[2/4]§2 Trials Overseer:§a Task 2! The task of flight. Every queen must be able to fly an airship.
§7[3/4]§2 Trials Overseer:§a Make sure ye bring yer reflexes girls, one false move and death awaits.
§7[4/4]§2 Trials Overseer:§a This task should filter out the rest of ye unworthy.
§7[1/7]§2 Trials Overseer:§a Well lookie here, an ametuer made it through her flight.
§7[2/7]§2 Trials Overseer:§a Well let’s see how you hold up in the final task ladies.
§7[3/7]§2 Trials Overseer:§a Yer ain’ a pirate at all if ye can’t steal, but this is different. 
§7[4/7]§2 Trials Overseer:§a This is the real deal. Stealin’ from a highly secure mansion.
§7[5/7]§2 Trials Overseer:§a Yer job is to steal a priceless treasure from the richest family in the sky.
§7[6/7]§2 Trials Overseer:§a We’ll be waiting with a getaway airship at the extraction point, everyone else'll left behind.
§7[7/7]§2 Trials Overseer:§a Remember, this be the real thing, and the defensive measures will be lethal. Good luck ladies.
§7[1/3]§a §2Trials Overseer: §aThis here is the garden you will be thrown into... you will have to find a way into the mansion. Maybe you can ask nicely?
§7[2/3]§a §2Trials Overseer: §aThis is the high value, mythic treasure that you're trying to thieve from the mansion... good luck, it is very highly defended both by man and machine.
§7[3/3]§a §2Trials Overseer: §aThis is the window you will be making your escape out of... we will be waiting for you outside of it. Good luck.
§7[1/1] §2Skyraider: §aAye', this is tha' little base that we use when we're attemptin' to raid the mansion, dig up that dirt to get to tha' courtyard!
§7[1/1] §2Courtyard Guard: §aSome skyraiders have been sneakin' into this garden and causin' havoc, tryin' to snatch the treasure! One of em' almost broke into the mansion by throwin' a rock and shatterin' one of the windows! What’s with the wig?
§7[1/1] §2Courtyard Guard: §aAh, I wasn't aware the boss was lettin' in some visitors... shouldn't hurt the establishment, eh?
§7[1/1] §2Construction Villager: §aHeh, some pesky skyraiders shattered a few windows on the upper floors... Gonna take a good while to fix em', but the boss wants it done quick, he doesn't like when his treasure is at risk.
§7[1/1] §2Courtyard Guard: §aArgh, recently a few skyraiders broke into the garden without any o' us noticing and almost broke into the mansion where the treasure is guarded, threw a rock in the window to try to get in, luckily one of us spooked em' off!
§7[1/1]§2 Mansion Guard:§a Aye', men! Tha' treasure has been stolen! Prepare the defenses!
§7[1/1] §2Trials Overseer: §aGrats on stealin' the treasure, you can board the airship through the window.
§a§7[1/8] §2Trials Overseer: §aAha! I figured it'd be ye to win o'er the rest of that lot… Ye've earned the proper sovereignty of bein' our ruler, our queen of the Skyraiders.
§a§7[2/8] §2Trials Overseer: §aDon't be worryin', we got this airship armoured somethin' heavy, and we’re miles away from their cannons… Nothin' to be afraid of, we're safe in this ship. 
§a§7[3/8] §2Trials Overseer: §aBut, first things first, let’s take a look inside that fancy box ye got, see what mythical treasures lay guarded behind those grubby guardsmen, shall we?
§a§7[4/8] §2Trials Overseer: §aBy the skies and seas…
§a§7[5/8] §2Trials Overseer: §aI hafta wonder now if this weren't bein' guarded for a bit of a nefarious reason. This be... Quite the weapon. It'd be deadly if this got used.
§a§7[6/8] §2Trials Overseer: §aWell, thanks to ye, us Skyraiders might have it now, but using this weapon against civilization would be beyond terrible. We might be pirates but we ain't heartless!
§a§7[7/8] §2Trials Overseer: §aI think we'll just have to keep this locked up nice n' tight once we get back. We'll be sure to tie this little cataclysm-in-a-box down much safer th'n those idiot men did.
§a§7[8/8] §2Trials Overseer: §aAha! Just gettin' back now. Let's head down and start the ceremony, shall we?
§7[1/3]§0 §2Trials Overseer:§0 §aI am pleased to introduce our 734th queen. Fer the sake of our people, let her reign last more than two weeks.
§7[2/3]§0 §2Trials Overseer:§0 §aI, on behalf on the rest of the Skyraider people, have the honor of decoratin' you with the highest decoration of the Skyraiders, §3[The Queen’s Headpiece].
§7[3/3]§0 §2Trials Overseer:§0 §aPlease use your sovereignty to lead us to the riches we deserve.       
§7[1/4] §2Trials Overseer: §aYer Majesty. What an honour to have such a beautiful queen.
§7[2/4] §2Trials Overseer: §aNow, we must crown ye, and give you yer reward.
§7[3/4] §2Trials Overseer: §aBenefits of being a queen I 'spose.
§7[4/4] §2Trials Overseer: §aPlease accept this, your majesty.
§7[1/1] §2Trials Overseer: §aGreetings, your majesty!
§7[1/1] §2Skyraider Guard: §aAye, my queen!
§d     -§7 Lore: §f§oOppressively dark and enigmatic, simply being inside this cave makes you feel disconnected from your body. Horrific power permeates the area...

§7[1/2]§2 Olux Plague Doctor:§a Hm? Aha, so the noises I heard were an uninvited guest rummaging about my laboratory...
§7[2/2]§2 Olux Plague Doctor:§a Well, I do suppose it would be rude to hide the fruits of my study from you. Perhaps you will even provide just what I need to complete my next experiment!
§7[1/12] §2Dogun Delg: §aGreat, now Humans are falling from the sky.
§7[2/12] §2Dogun Delg: §aI came here to seek asylum, but it seems I cannot escape.
§7[3/12] §2Dogun Delg: §aYou look like you've never seen a Dogun before.
§7[4/12] §2Dogun Delg: §aI'm not surprised. There are very few left now.
§7[5/12] §2Dogun Delg: §aThose of us that are left were forced to surface into hiding.
§7[6/12] §2Dogun Delg: §aYou can't seriously think the dwarves were born underground, do you?
§7[7/12] §2Dogun Delg: §aNo, they took our lands. Waged a bloody war for years.
§7[8/12] §2Dogun Delg: §aIt was a lengthy, complicated war between 3 species and a few gods.
§7[9/12] §2Dogun Delg: §aI myself ran after the Dogun capital fell to the stump legs.
§7[10/12] §2Dogun Delg: §aI'm not going to regale you with war stories, but lets just say your little friends under the mountain are not the allies you thought they were.
§7[11/12] §2Dogun Delg: §aI keep some old war documents around, if you were really interested you could read those.
§7[12/12] §2Dogun Delg: §aI won't be shedding anymore lava thinking about what could have been.

§d                         §d§lOcean History
§7    §7§oThe ocean has always operated as a buffer zone between the Gavel and Wynn province. It was mostly uninhabited for centuries, as the ocean was rough and deadly.
§7    §7§oIt wasn't until the discovery of water magic on a huge scale that mages were able to settle the waves to allow movement of boats across the ocean.
§7    §7§oSince the wave calming over 100 years ago, the islands in the ocean have been heavily colonised by Humans and Villagers alike, mainly to avoid the creatures of the portal.
§7    §7§oAlthough secluded, the islands offered a very desirable haven from the war for many humans, and offered great naval commerce locations for the Villagers.
§7    §7§oThe largest of all islands, Corkus, was not colonised by either Wynn or Gavel, but rather by a group of separatists from Fruma.
§7    §7§oNot much is known about this land, only that it is incredibly advanced and although the people originally did not know a spell between them, they are now masters of industrial magic.
§7    §7§oHowever, much like Fruma, the people there are incredibly secluded, and it is unknown to which province their allegiance holds.
§7    §7§oGavel has a lot to learn from the mechanical land of Corkus.
§d                         §d§lGavel History
§7    §7§oThe new fortunes made by the Villagers has allowed them to construct an entire city to welcome the cheap labour arriving from the Wynn province.
§7    §7§oLlevigar, constructed of expensive marble is the icon of the province and holds immense industrial magical power to encourage more movement of people to the province.
§7    §7§oVillagers are not often not willing to do tasks that involve a lot of travelling or combat.
§7    §7§oTherefore, they have benefitted immensely from the movement of adventurers from the Wynn province, to whom they share the rewards of business ventures.
§7    §7§oOften a very small share is given to the work force. Magical skill, money and the natural resources of Gavel allow it to thrive as a multicultural society.
§7    §7§oGavel proclaims itself as the most advanced province in the world.
§d                         §d§lWynn History
§7    §7§oBefore 1000 years ago, not much was known about the Wynn province. It used to be a Human dominated province, mainly agricultural.
§7    §7§oMost of the population migrated from Fruma, to escape the monarchy in search of new lands. After the opening of the portal, things took a turn for the worse.
§7    §7§oThe evil that was unleashed from the theorised realms war almost brought the province to it's knees.
§7    §7§oHowever, ironically it is the distinguishing event that made Wynn the center of the world.
§7    §7§oFruma initially abandoned all ties with the province and closed it's doors to the undead, and it's migrants.
§7    §7§oThe province waged war on it's enemies for centuries, creating legends and ultimately a province of warriors.
§7    §7§oThe war became so second nature to the province that children were able to kill before they could talk properly.
§7    §7§oCommunity and a strong national presence made the province admirable and formidable.
