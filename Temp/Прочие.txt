§7[5/7] §2Legendary Attendant: §aThe six types are based on the five elements, along with another type that combines all five.
§7[6/7] §2Legendary Attendant: §aThe Gold Merchant allows you to upgrade a Silver accessory into a Gold accessory of the same element.

§7[1/6] §2Yansur: §aHrm, perhaps we have underestimated you. The creations of Air have defeated thousands, particularly-
§7[2/6] §2Qira: §a§lHush, Yansur. Not a word about her.
§7[3/6] §2Yansur: §a...yes§a. Here is the promised Air Voucher.
§7[4/6] §2Yansur: §aThe shop has your reward prepared. If you have not talked to the servant at the shop, do so next you go there.
§7[5/6] §2Yansur: §aYou still have a long way to go. It is not easy to gain an audience with Mistress Qira.
§7[6/6] §2Yansur: §aYour next objective is to clear the Earth division. Some of the most powerful, raw creatures ever hatched.
§7[1/1] §2Qira: §a§lBegin, the Earth Division! You must withstand both sheer force and deadly toxins! Be quick on your feet, or you will return to the dust of the earth!
§7Seems you can move on... All you hear is a bloodcurdling roar. What lies ahead...?
§7Well, now that you've destroyed that terrible thing, it seems prudent to tell Yansur and get your Earth Voucher.

§7[2/6] §2Qira: §a§lManaged to defeat Genesis, hm? It is normally the end of most... Interesting.
§7[3/6] §2Yansur: §aWell, here is your Earth Voucher.
§7[5/6] §2Yansur: §aIt is impressive to see how far you have come. Many have failed at this point.
§7[6/6] §2Yansur: §aIt is of no consequence, however, for the Water division is your next challenge. I am sure you will not succeed.
§7[1/1] §2Qira: §a§lBegin, the Water Division! If you will not withstand the crashing waves, the creatures that lurk within shall ensure you never emerge from the abyss!
§7[1/1] §2:????: §aYou have been judged worthy enough to face me in combat. However, I know your strength, and I do not believe it enough to defeat me. Come forth now. Make your attempt to prove me wrong.
§7[1/2] §2Oceanic Judge: §aSeems my judgment was incorrect. In this case, however, it is refreshing to see.
§7[2/2] §2Oceanic Judge: §aContinue forwards, honourable human. Perhaps your intellect and respect will rub off on that insufferable Yansur.
§7[1/6] §2Yansur: §aImpossible. Not even the most tactically advanced monsters could defeat you.
§7[2/6] §2Qira: §a§l...The§a§l Judge needs further tweaking, I am not satisfied with his current state. Nevertheless, I must admit I am impressed.
§7[2/6] §2Yansur: §a...Here's§a the Water Voucher you're expecting.
§7[3/6] §2Yansur: §aThe shop has your reward prepared. If you have not talked to the servant at the shop, do so next you go there.
§7[4/6] §2Yansur: §aWe are intrigued by your determination... But we are not worried. We do not expect you to make it past the next floor.
§7[5/6] §2Yansur: §aNow you must face some of the toughest creatures of Mistress Qira's imagination!
§7[6/6] §2Yansur: §aYou must now face the division of Fire, and it will be sure to burn you.
§7[1/1] §2Qira: §a§lBegin, the Fire Division! Summon your courage, and brave the heat of the volcanoes and stars for my amusement, else burn to cinders and blow away in the breeze!
§7[1/1] §2????: §aImpressive, making it this far. I am your final test. Let us fight fairly, then. An honourable end to your challenge is only fitting, whether that be triumph or defeat. Come forward and face me.
§4This note seems unimportant for now.
§7[1/2] §2Solar Vanguard: §aDefeat feels strange, after so long. You fought valiantly, and with great zeal, however. It would be a lie to say I am disappointed. Impart these traits onto Mistress's servant, if you would, and claim your final prize.
§7[2/2] §2Solar Vanguard: §aAll that is left is to talk to Mistress's servant, and claim your final prize. Surely he will not be as great an obstacle as I was.
§7[1/11] §2Yansur: §aThis is unprecedented. You have defeated some of the most recent and powerful creations.

§7[7/11] §2Qira: §a§lYou have intrigued me, §a§ladventurer...and§a§l I want to put you to the truest test.
§7[8/11] §2Yansur: §aHah! Incredible! Mistress wishes to battle you herself! You astound me.
§7[9/11] §2Yansur: §aBe warned, however. This will be your toughest battle yet. Mistress Qira is the most feared being in Gavel.
§7[10/11] §2Yansur: §aYou will §adie...but§a consider it the greatest honour to die by her hand.
§7[11/11] §2Qira: §a§lI await you in my chambers...

§7[2/14] §2Yansur: §aI had begun to think highly of you, but after such a disgusting display-
§7[3/14] §2Qira: §a§lThey defeated me, Yansur.

§7[7/14] §2Yansur: §aTo be defeated by a human of Wynn... I am not sure whether to be disappointed or amazed. Our ultimate challenge has been bested.
§7[8/14] §2Qira: §a§lIt is simply a testament to their strength. I will prepare a special reward for them to mark the occasion.
§7[9/14] §2Yansur: §aHere is your voucher, then. The back room in the shop will have your rewards. If you still have not talked to the servant at the §ashop...well§a. You should know by now.
§7[10/14] §2Yansur: §aMistress...if§a I may tell the tale? She was once called upon to help stop the decay of the forest.
§7[11/14] §2Yansur: §aWith her boundless knowledge and magic, she surely could have cured it. But she declined.
§7[12/14] §2Yansur: §aShe instead chose to create, obsessed with preparing for some sort of war.
§7[13/14] §2Yansur: §aMistress never elaborated, but it seems like she knows something we don't.
§7[14/14] §2Qira: §a§lIt is as I have always told you. The darkness is §a§lcoming...but§a§l if you Wynn folk are all as strong as you have proven yourself to be, we may just be able to beat it back. Honour to you, warrior of Wynn.
