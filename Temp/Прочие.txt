§d     -§7 Location: §fNesaak Tundra [1/1]
§d     -§7 About Discovery: §f§oThis old library has been slumbering beneath Lusuco for years. It tells the story of the legendary Twain children.
§d                 §d§lThe Noble House of Twain
§7    §7§oWhen the portal opened 1000 years ago, magic was not wielded by the hands of man.
§7    §7§oAlthough totally capable of performing spells - just like fire, magic had to be discovered..
§7    §7§oThere were however, humans that possessed natural magical gifts. Gifts that needed no teaching or practice.
§7    §7§oThese people were few and far between, and rarely did they possess enough power to fight corruption.
§7    §7§oBefore the time of Bob however, these people were invaluable and are probably responsible for keeping the province alive.
§7    §7§oDuring the early years of the war of corruption, there was only localised defence from these people.
§7    §7§oIt wasn’t until Marius Twain, a particularly gifted man, decided to organise a team.
§7    §7§oBeing an orphan during the war was very common place. And like many others, this included gifted individuals.
§7    §7§oMarius took in any orphaned children with gifts. Gifts for magical prowess, particularly those with elemental magic.
§7    §7§oAll the children he adopted took on his name, Twain and lived with him in his formidable manor hidden from the prying eyes of the portal.
§7    §7§oMarius taught them to control their powers and use them to fight the corrupt. His 4 true proteges were Rickeo, Theorick, Dwendle and Mael.
§7    §7§oAlthough other Twains had gifts, they were not really made for war.
§7    §7§oWith Rickeo's manipulation of fire, Dwendle's control of air and Theorick's ability to govern ice, the largest threats to the integrity of the province were dealt with.
§7    §7§oMael, however, did not possess the same type of powers as his siblings (though they are not blood related, the inhabitants of the house of Twain were always considered a family).
§7    §7§oMael was able to communicate with the dead, or more specifically, the spirits that lingered to walk the earth. He was also able to produce black mystic wisps to damage his opponents.
§7    §7§oMael was by far the most recluse member of the Twain family, and spent most of his time listening to the woes of the departed that had unfinished business.
§7    §7§oMany people considered Mael's brand of magic to be "dark" and avoided him.
§7    §7§o"People fear the dead" was the reason Marius gave Mael for his obvious unpopularity among his siblings, "you are a reminder that we are all simply mortal, despite our gifts".
§7    §7§oMael wondered if Marius really was mortal; he seemed to tell stories at least 200 years old. Alas, he was mortal. Marius died of old age and gave the children instructions to continue the House of Twain's noble work.
§7    §7§oEven in death the corrupt were not entirely vanquished. They often lingered as spirits.
§7    §7§oMael was often left to deal with the angry spirits, for he was the only one able to handle their wrath. The physical elements that defeated them in life, were no match for them in death.
§7    §7§oThe other siblings grew tiresome with Mael's reluctance to forever get rid of the spirits of the dead that remained, none more so than Theorick.
§7    §7§oHe frequently reminded Mael that he would freeze his spirit out of him if he didn't take care of the monsters who they dealt with while they were alive.
§7    §7§oMael however, had his own way, he sought to calm the spirits and send them ... "on".
§7    §7§oIn his anger, Theorick couldn't stand to stay in the Twain manor any longer, and left to live in the nearest village, Nesaak. He protected it with his life.
§7    §7§oBitter in their old age, the siblings did not fulfill Marius' wishes, they did not seek out gifted children.
§7    §7§oThey all went their separate ways, all except Mael, who remained in the manor to aid the spirits that sought him.
§7    §7§oTheir power and influence in the province was severely weakened as communication broke down.
§7    §7§oThe four children of Twain although powerful and kept the province alive, were not the best symbol of humanity.
§7    §7§oEventually, one by one, the Twains fell. Some to Bak’al - immortal leader of the corrupt, some to corruption itself.
§7    §7§oAll dead, except for Mael, who was determined to teach at least one more worthy of his knowledge of the spiritual world.
§7    §7§oSo, the House of Twain fell into decline. Mael, unable to look after himself in his old age, spent the remainder of his time in a secret library learning arts to pass on to the one worthy.
§7    §7§oIt was a young Bob who found Mael, and through him, Bob learned spiritual knowledge and the history of Wynn.
§7    §7§oEventually Mael passed on, leaving the souls that could not be tamed in the manor.
§7    §7§oThey roam the house, aggressive to anyone they may encounter.
§a                            Chapter VIII
§7    §7§oTo the present day, the Manor remains full of unsatisfied spirits.
§7    §7§oIt remains one of the few places that monsters from the portal will not go, but that does not mean it is by any means safe.
§7    §7§oRumours float around in the eternal winter village of Nesaak that there are still secrets to be discovered, as Mael had a lot to hide. The house of Twain stood for several years protecting this province, but now no original Twain remains.
§7    §7§oHowever, Mael left a will to the last remaining honorary Twai-

§7    §7§oNo one knows exactly when the province borders formed between Fruma and Wynn; such tales are lost to time.
§7    §7§oThe Ragni mountains that dominate the landscape have served as a natural barrier between the contrasting lands.
§7    §7§oThere is only a single, well travelled passage through them to connect the two.
§7    §7§oThe border has been closed for over a thousand years and is strictly regulated by the mysterious governing force of Fruma.
§7    §7§oImmigration has always been entirely a one way system. People leave Fruma, and enter Wynn.
§7    §7§oPeople who wish to attempt the opposite are more than welcome to try, however they are met with a hail of aggression from the Kai Shi, the Fruman royal guard.
§c§7The lift has been called down...
§7    §7§oThe slow release of the Fruman population into the province of Wynn began a thousand years ago, at the start of Wynn's corruption outbreak.
§7    §7§oWhat is most peculiar about the situation is that none of the “recruits” seem to know anything about their origins.
§7    §7§oInformation about Fruma is scarce to none due to this mysterious amnesia.
§7    §7§oThe one-way arrangement has been in place for so long that it has become entirely normal and mostly unquestioned.
§7    §7§o350 years ago, however, a splinter group left Fruma through the mountains on the northern coastline.
§7    §7§oThis was a feat previously thought impossible due to the unnatural mountain range and another, heavily guarded passage.
§c§7The lift has been called up...
§a§7The lift has successfully ascended!
§7    §7§oThese rebels were highly skilled workers who, much like the Wynn recruits, lost the memories of their origins once they passed through the mountains.
§7    §7§oConfused, scared and vulnerable, they migrated to a large island close to the northern gate: the island of Corkus.
§7    §7§oBack then, Corkus was an entirely independent, peaceful and self-sustaining nation.
§7    §7§oIts sole inhabitants were the Avos, a bird-like humanoid that colonised the rocky terrain and steep cliffs long ago.
§7    §7§oAvos history is relatively unknown but their beliefs and practices are entrenched in spiritual and natural magic.
§7    §7§oAvos are truly one with nature and respect all living things, which explained their willingness to grant asylum to any refugees who washed up on their shores, regardless of origin.
§7    §7§oThus began the era of the Corkians on the island. But, while the Avos gave an inch, the new humans took a foot.
§7    §7§oThe Avos granted them their own borders, and they steadily grew over the years.
§7    §7§oToday, the humans occupy the majority of the island.
§7    §7§oThe new Corkians, while still reserving the legal right to occupy and govern themselves, do not own the island.
§7    §7§oAlthough the lands are internationally recognised solely as Avos territory, a self sufficient neutral land, the real story is quite the opposite.
§7    §7§oOver the 350 years of dual occupation, tensions have grown between the two civilizations.

§7    §7§oThe Avos, still clinging to their old spiritual beliefs, occupy the highest mountains where it is unfeasible for the Humans to live.
§7    §7§oThe Corkians, in the lowlands, have forged a truly industrial nation.
§7    §7§oThey did not possess any magical knowledge when they departed Fruma; such power was restricted only to those at the top of the Fruman hierarchy.
§7    §7§oHowever, left to their own devices for a few hundred years, skilled Corkian workers soon discovered they were capable of harnessing the most obscure of the arts:
§7    §7§oElectromagic, the magic of machines.
§7    §7§oThey utilized the plentiful natural resources of the island to develop the most advanced and magnificent creations to aid them in everyday life.
§7    §7§oCurrently, while tensions are at their most severe, neither the Avos nor the Corkians are seen as the enemy. Both have remained allies for the most part.
§7    §7§oThe Avos have enjoyed the advanced medicine and aide from their industrially adept Human guests, while they have maintained their traditional hunter-gatherer lifestyle.
§7    §7§oHowever, one major disagreement between the two groups has caused a rift between them.
§7    §7§oThe Avos are fundamentally against the environmentally destructive wake left by Humans, and in response erected a wall as a symbol of their displeasure.
§7    §7§oThe Corkians did not react at all, instead attempting to maintain their positive and peaceful relationship with the island owners without ceasing their industrial activities.
§7    §7§oThe ocean has been considered a neutral buffer zone between the three provinces for some time, leaving the occupants of most islands somewhat unrepresented, with the exception of Selchar.
§7    §7§oCorkus, however, is no exception. The Corkians seek international recognition from the other provinces as one of their own.
§7    §7§oWhile the Avos simply wish to exist in harmony with the wind and waves, this was not enough for the new occupants.
§7    §7§oThe basic Human need for recognition kicked in, and the Corkians were determined to get it.
§7    §7§oTheir method is not through conquest or economic domination, but through the display of their technological might.
§7    §7§oThe Corkians are indeed ahead of their time; the closest the Villagers ever got to a independent machine was a horrific mix of flesh and steel.
§7    §7§oThough the machines of Corkus were impressive, they paled in comparison to what they called their national monument: The Factory.
§7    §7§oThe Factory is a massive facility from which all of their machines originate. It is capable of producing an army in a matter of weeks.
§7    §7§oIt would surely prove to the other provinces that Corkus is deserving of international representation, especially since it may prove to be indispensable as a tool against the corruption.
§7    §7§oTeething problems have proved to hinder their plight for recognition.
§7    §7§oThe electromagical force that governs the Factory seems to have an agenda of it’s own, and some machines have rebelled against their creators.
§7    §7§oThe resourceful Corkians have since shut down the factory to fix the problem.
§7    §7§oHowever, the land is still scattered with pockets of desperate mechanicals searching for much needed spare parts.
§7    §7§oOnce they solve the problems of the Factory's governing force, Corkus is likely to become an international superpower.
§7    §7§oTheir ingenuity and industrial progression can no longer be ignored, regardless of the Avos' situation.
