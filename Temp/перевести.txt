§7[2/8] §2Chef Hamsey: §aOh do mes yeuxs deceive me? Could it be?!
§7[3/8] §2Chef Hamsey: §aMon amie.. the novice soldier a hero! Who would have thought!
§7[4/8] §2Chef Hamsey: §aLet moi explain. Je suis le cook from Ragni!
§7[5/8] §2Chef Hamsey: §aI travelled to lands far and wide, learned their techniques and made a restaurant in le Sky Islands.
§7[6/8] §2Chef Hamsey: §aI would offer you a meal, but ce n'est pas le temps!
§7[7/8] §2Chef Hamsey: §aYou may have mastered the art of battle, but what of the art of cuisine?
§7[8/8] §2Chef Hamsey: §aFollow me into the kitchen behind me, there I will tell you more.
§7[1/7] §2Chef Hamsey: §aWelcome to ma cuisine! C'est beau, non?
§7[2/7] §2Chef Hamsey: §aIt may be on fire, but what is cooking without un peu de danger?
§7[3/7] §2Chef Hamsey: §aBack to my challenge. What you must do is surpass moi in the art of cuisiner by making a dish.
§7[4/7] §2Chef Hamsey: §aThis will involve gathering all the ingredients you choose to use, making it n'est pas chose facile!
§7[5/7] §2Chef Hamsey: §aPresent it to one of my trois meilleur chefs of mine, and they will pass that dish onto me.
§7[6/7] §2Chef Hamsey: §aIf you triumph, I shall make you a chef dans mon restaurant.. Fail and never again vous cuisinerez içi!
§7[7/7] §2Chef Hamsey: §aMay the culinary gods be in your faveur, aventurier.
§7[1/1] §2Kale: §aTalk to Chef Hamsey before you talk to me, he has things to explain.
§7[1/5] §2Brie: §aHeya! You must be the adventurer that Hamsey told me about. You know, he was almost ecstatic, but don't tell him I said that!
§7[2/5] §2Brie: §aUsually he's not even half as cheerful as he is now, so you must be a good friend of his.
§7[3/5] §2Brie: §aOh, a cook-off? How exciting! I'll gladly help you out. Maybe this way I can prove myself a bit more to the others...?
§7[4/5] §2Brie: §aActually, nevermind that. If we work together, we can make a Zork Stew, how does that sound?
§7[5/5] §2Brie: §aYou need to talk to the other chefs before deciding what to make, though! Kale is closest, so you should talk to him first I guess.
§7[1/5] §2Kale: §aWhen Hamsey told me about a good friend of his, I didn't expect... this.
§7[2/5] §2Kale: §aAs you can clearly see, I am the best chef in this kitchen by far! Hamsey should be the one working for me, but my tastes are far too superior to the residents of Gavel, let alone Wynn.
§7[3/5] §2Kale: §aNo one appreciates the finer tastes in life in current times. That reminds me, why am I talking to someone like §a§lyou§a?
§7[4/5] §2Kale: §aI saw you already talked to Brie, so the last chef that you need to talk to is Frank.
§7[5/5] §2Kale: §aFrankly, you wouldn't miss much not talking to him. What does Hamsey even see in such a lazy individual?
§7[1/4] §2Frank: §aHow are ya? Hamsey said you're an old buddy of his, helped him while he was still in Ragni.
§7[2/4] §2Frank: §aName's Frank, good to meet you. So, ol' Hamsey roped you into a cook-off, huh? Ah, he does stuff like this all the time. You've got no idea how many days off I've spent in this place for these...
§7[3/4] §2Frank: §aI don't have any dish in mind, but I'm sure we can come up with something if you decide to get my help.
§7[4/4] §2Frank: §aSince you've talked to all three of us, you might as well talk to whoever you think suits you best. Good luck with the competition and all that.
§7[1/9] §2Frank: §aSo you decided to work with me, huh? I promise I won't dissapoint.
§7[2/9] §2Frank: §aAs I mentioned, Hamsey usually forgets he created a cook-off in the first place, so it's up to me to do the work for him. It's fine, don't get me wrong, but working with someone new is always fun.
§7[3/9] §2Frank: §aEh, can't he helped. So, what to cook, what to §acook...ah§a, the eternal question.
§7[4/9] §2Frank: §aHm... Well, I might be a bit of a lazy guy, but when it comes to cooking, I've got the eye. I can't lie, you look like a real Skyhigh Pie kind of guy to me! Heheh.
§7[5/9] §2Frank: §aYou probably know the basics, right? I mean, you wouldn't just walk in here with no cooking knowledge, right?
§7[6/9] §2Frank: §aAh, don't give me that look, I'm not gonna leave you here on your own. First off, we need some §3[Sunrise Flour]§a.
§7After looking at your map, you conclude that you need to go to [1103,113,-4434] to obtain the §3[Sunrise Flour]§7.
§7[7/9] §2Frank: §aThen, a good sized §3[Blue-Ring Grook Egg]§a. I bet Kale would "conveniently" forget to mention this, but Ringtail Grooks tend to get a bit ferocious if you take their eggs.
§7After looking at your map, you conclude that you need to go to [626,43,-4645] to obtain the §3[Blue-Ring Grook Egg]§7.
§7[8/9] §2Frank: §aNow, we gotta shake up this pie a little bit, so how about some §3[Skyhigh Raspberry]§a? Real tasty, but it's quite the walk to get 'em. A bit of walking never hurt anybody, but I couldn't be bothered to.
§7After looking at your map, you conclude that you need to go to [1400,102,-3940] to obtain the §3[Skyhigh Raspberry]§7.
§7[9/9] §2Frank: §aGot all that? If you need a refresher, hit me up again. Just be sure to check your map if you get lost looking for all this stuff.
§7[1/1] §2Frank: §aIn case ya forgot, the ingredients are §3[Sunrise Flour]§a, §3[Blue-Ring Grook Egg]§a and §3[Skyhigh Raspberry]§a.
§7Looking at your map, these ingredients should be at [1103,113,-4434], [626,43,-4645] and [1400,102,-3940] respectively.
§7[1/7] §2Baker: §aHello there! I can see you knead some sunrise flour, don't you? 
§7[2/7] §2Baker: §aIt's needed rye away? Well no worries, friend!
§7[3/7] §2Baker: §aWell butter me up and call me toast, it seems I ran out of the stuff, there's none left.
§7[4/7] §2Baker: §aI'm sorry if I seem to be just loafing around, but at yeast I know how to make some more.
§7[5/7] §2Baker: §aCan you see that wheat field over there, next to the bakery? You can collect some wheat and throw it on the grinding wheel in the bakery.
§7[6/7] §2Baker: §aYou are going to knead some §3[High Quality Sunrise Wheat]§a to make it, however.
§7[7/7] §2Baker: §aMake as much as you want, I've made all the bread I need for today already.
§7You hear faint clucking up ahead.. The Grooks seem to be angry with you for taking an egg.
§7[1/1] §2Chef Hamsey: §aCome into the kitchen, mon ami.
§7[1/2] §2Frank: §aWell done on getting them items, some of 'em are pretty tough to find!
§7You use the oven to bake a simple egg and flour dough filled with Skyhigh Raspberries. Smells like... pie?
§7[2/2] §2Frank: §aGo on ahead into Hamsey's private dining area, over there to my left. Good luck.
§7[1/4] §2Chef Hamsey: §aI see you've returned, and not empty handed. Please, show me what you've created!
§7[2/4] §2Chef Hamsey: §aA pie? Why, you must have been helped by Frank. He always has a thing for making pie!
§7You barely take your first bite into Chef Hamsey's dish before it melts in your mouth... Will the pie manage to match Hamsey's skills?
§7[3/4] §2Chef Hamsey: §aI can see that your compétences culinaires are almost at par with mine!
§7[4/4] §2Chef Hamsey: §aThough I will not truly call you a chef quite yet, you are très bien! Have this reward as congratulations!
§7[1/2] §2Antrus: §aThe void does strange things toooo our bodies. Just look at us! We've lived down here for one thousand years without dying.

§7[1/1] §2Celuuse: §aBack here again? I thought Rontaid got everything sorted out for youuuuuu.

§7We did not count this death towards your hardcore status.
