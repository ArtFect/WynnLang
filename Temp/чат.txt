§7[1/2] §2Psilo: §aWelcome, welcome! My humble little home welcomes travellers of all shapes and sizes!@§7[1/2] §2Psilo: §aПривет и добро пожаловать! Мой скромный маленький дом приветствует путешественников всех форм и размеров!
§7[2/2] §2Psilo: §aHowever, the problem I'm having can't be solved by anyone under Level 76. Come back when you can!@§7[2/2] §2Psilo: §aТем не менее, проблема, с которой я столкнулся, не может быть решена кем-либо ниже 76 уровня. Возвращайся, когда сможешь!
§7[1/1] §2Ahmsord Citizen: §aI'm so glad Sky's Kitchen reopened recently. The food there is delicious!@§7[1/1] §2Ahmsord Citizen: §aЯ так рад, что ресторан Sky's Kitchen открылся недавно. Еда там очень вкусная!
§7[1/5] §2Worid: §aGreat, you've proven your ability of stealth and strength by breaking into the storage in Detlas, we can start the real thing now.@§7[1/5] §2Worid: §aОтлично, ты доказал свою способность к скрытности и силе, взломав хранилище в Детласе, мы можем начать настоящее дело прямо сейчас.
§7[2/5] §2Worid: §aYou see, Almuj has a very well guarded emerald vault named "The Emerald Labyrinth".@§7[2/5] §2Worid: §aВидишь ли, в Алмуже есть очень хорошо охраняемое хранилище эмеральдов, называемое "Эмеральдовый Лабиринт"
§7[3/5] §2Worid: §aIt is guarded with tons of well trained Guard Golem, who can kill anyone in one hit.@§7[3/5] §2Worid: §aТам находится очень много тренированных охранников-големов, которые могут с легкостью убить любого за один удар...
§7[4/5] §2Worid: §aThe Banker in the secret vault must be completely bored out of his mind, and won't mind if you find him.@§7[4/5] §2Worid: §aБанкир в тайном хранилище должно быть скучает в одиночестве, и не будет возражать, если ты найдешь его.
§7[5/5] §2Worid: §aGood luck with that. Haha.. I mean, *cough*.@§7[5/5] §2Worid: §aУдачи с этим. Хаха.. То есть, *кашляет*.
§7[1/1] §2Kofis: §aOh, you're that kid from before. Heh, surprised you didn't get lost again.@§7[1/1] §2Kofis: §aО, ты же тот парень. Удивлен, что ты больше не заблудился.
§7[1/2] §2Marston: §aDo ye remember where to go?@§7[1/2] §2Marston: §aТы помнишь куда плыть?
§7[2/2] §2Marston: §aNo? The crew be loiterin' at Pirate Cove. I'll be along soon, don't ye worry!@§7[2/2] §2Marston: §aНет? Команда слоняется без дела в Пиратской Бухте. Я скоро приду, не волнуйся!
§7[1/3] §2Phinas: §aOh my, oh my.@§7[1/3] §2Phinas: §aО боже, боже.
§7[2/3] §2Phinas: §aLook at this mess!@§7[2/3] §2Phinas: §aПосмотри на этот беспорядок!
§7[3/3] §2Phinas: §aDespermechs did this. I would expect you need to be level 86 to handle them.@§7[3/3] §2Phinas: §aОтчаянные роботы сделали это. Ты нужен мне на 86 уровне чтобы справиться с ними.
§7[1/1] §2Heliorion: §aYou have shown immense bravery. I wish you good luck in defeating Orphion. He is an immense foe. Our protector has become our enemy, and I am terrified for all.@§7[1/1] §2Heliorion: §aТы проявил огромную храбрость. Желаю тебе удачи в борьбе с Орфионом. Он - огромный враг. Наш защитник стал нашим врагом, и я боюсь за всех.
§7[1/1] §2Batelu: §aHow is your quest going along?
§7[1/1] §2Aluxander: §aPerhaps maybe the spread of darkness can be stopped… But I don't think these areas will ever recover.
§7[4/4] §2Kofis: §aI guess you better go on and find the rest of the crew. Judging by those letters you have there, you still need to find 1 more of us.
§7[1/1] §2Ansei: §aMake sure to tell Dejol everyone's all right!
§7[1/1] §2Aryn: §aWho are you, why did you come here?
§7[1/1] §2Challenger Apprentice: §aI congratulate you my friend on your success in the challenges, but the real reward in this situation is the experience, not the physical reward!
§7[1/1] §2Challenger Apprentice: §aI see you have mustered the power to defeat all four challenges. You have my utmost respect.
§7[1/1] §2Challenger Apprentice: §aI congratulate you on your recent success regarding the four challenges. I envy you and your success.
§7[1/1] §2Captured Gert: §aHuman! Come close, gert hunger! Gert eat human!
§7[1/1] §2Batelu: §aYou can't enter yet!
§7[1/2] §2Adamastor: §aWhy must you humans always try to intervene in matters that aren't your own?
§7[2/2] §2Adamastor: §aLeave, now... Or we will bring your death. And we will ensure that there will be no one to bring you back, either.
§7[1/1] §2Elrund: §aHello again, traveller. You did well to pass all of my trials.
§7[1/1] §2Lozeg: §aThis theatre play is far too scary for you, come back when you reach level 91.
§7[4/4] §2Felim: §aSo you were delivering that message to the entire crew? Well, looks like you only need to get to 3 more of us.
§7[4/4] §2Sytis: §aI see you were delivering the same message to the entire crew. Well, looks like you only need to deliver it to 2 more of us.
§7[4/4] §2Kofis: §aI guess you better go on and let Dejol know we've all got the message. He should still be by his blue flag.
§7[1/1] §2Kofis: §aNow that you've delivered all of those letters, you should probably head back to Dejol.
§7[1/2] §2Olivin: §aMo'in! How was Corkus?
§7[2/2] §2Olivin: §aMagical I assume.
§7[1/1] §2Gaclux: §aThis rune is sealing Orphion... I suggest you stay away in case he ever breaks free.
§7[1/1] §2Gaclux: §aHey! Are you just going to be abandon us in our time of need?
§7[1/2] §2Captain Olof: §aWe need some kind of glue, 10 of it.
§7[2/2] §2Captain Olof: §aWe'll also need sand for glass, 5 of it.
§7[1/5]§2 Rex:§a We got this, just take care of the monsters while we build the bridge! 
§7[1/2] §2Arlene: §aI've been hearing a lot of strange sounds...
§7[2/2] §2Arlene: §aIt sounds like something is flying around us! What if monsters are flying around us!?
§7[1/1]§2 Captain Olof:§a Get out of here and try again!
§7[1/2] §2Burne: §aI'm bored, I want to go back home.
§7[2/2] §2Burne: §aI just came because I wanted the reward, I'm not planning on helping.
§7[1/5] §2Cinfras Citizen: §aOh, a human, eh? You must be fairly strong to have gotten here. Let me help you out with a bit of advice, then.
§7[2/5] §2Cinfras Citizen: §aIn The Canyon of the Lost to the east, there's...a dreadful place. The Qira Hive, people call it. No one likes talking about it.
§7[3/5] §2Cinfras Citizen: §aAn immensely powerful sorceress, Qira, own it. She's somehow managed to get it recognized as a sovereign state. We can't touch her.
§7[4/5] §2Cinfras Citizen: §aShe offers a challenge to fight your way through her Hive... Apparently if you do it, you get to talk with her and broker for some kind of request.
§7[5/5] §2Cinfras Citizen: §aOnly a couple of groups have ever done it. Only one ever came back. If you value your life, steer clear. We don't need soldiers like you dying on us.
§7[1/1] §2Guardian of The Forest: §a...
§7[1/1] §2Damien: §aI probably owe you my life. Thank you so much for the medicine.
§7[1/2] §2Talking Mushroom: §aOH MY, LOOKS WHO'S BACK. HERE I THOUGHT I WAS FREE OF YOUR GRASP AND THEN YOU COME BACK HERE.
§7[2/2] §2Talking Mushroom: §aWAS PUTTING ME ON SOME EGGS NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU? I BARELY MANAGED TO RUN AWAY LOSING JUST A STEM!
§7[1/2] §2Jesp: §aPfft. I would've done a better job saving the windshield.
§7[2/2] §2Jesp: §aToo bad I was in another room.
§7[1/1] §2Elio: §aUNTIE ME!
§7[1/1] §2Hazel: §aDid you ever find out anything about the decay? Eh, whatever. It doesn't matter. There's nothing we can do about it.
§7[1/1] §2Mansion Guard: §aOi', you! Whatcha' think yer' doin' sneakin' around these parts? This be a restricted area! Yer' headed to the jail cell!
§7[1/1] §2Trials Overseer: §aMove along, ya' got clearance to board the airship!
§7[1/1] §2Hrona: §aCongratulations, my queen! May yer rule be the best one!
§7[1/2] §2Talking Mushroom: §aYOU KNOW, HAVE I EVER TOLD YOU HOW MUCH I HA-
§7[2/2] §2Talking Mushroom: §aACTUALLY, WHERE EVEN ARE WE? THIS PLACE FEELS WEIRDLY FAMILIAR, AS IF I'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE.
§7[1/1] §2Regulux: §aBy destroying those seeds, you have not just saved my life, but all of the heliolux. On behalf of them, thank you.
§7[1/1] §2YahyaBot V4.04: §aY-you're going to h-have to beat me if you want a taste of my m-m-mushroom soup!
§7[1/2] §2YahyaBot V4.04: §aWARNING: Defense systems critical! Power reserves low! Mushroom fuel reserves empty!
§7[2/2] §2YahyaBot V4.04: §aInitiating emergency shutdown...
§7[1/1] §2Dr. Legendary: §aLadies and gentlemen, performing you live from Legendary Stadium... it^s Death Metal and the Ascendant Bosses!
§7[1/1] §2Robob: §aOnly the most powerful warriors are worthy to face me. And by the looks of it, you barely made the cut.
§7[1/1] §2Orange Cybel: §aYou've wasted every chance you had to turn back. And you're §a§oreally§a not going to like what happens now.
§7[1/2] §2Dr. Legendary: §aSo, you decided to come, then? Then let's see how you fare against the Champion of Legendary Island...
§7[2/2] §2Dr. Legendary: §a§lDoctor Herbert von Legendary!
§7[1/6] §2Dr. Legendary: §a...
§7[2/6] §2Dr. Legendary: §aI'm still in shock. I, the creator and controller of the strongest mechs in the world, have been defeated!
§7[3/6] §2Dr. Legendary: §aAll of my research, sponsored by Corkus, of course, was still not enough. You have truly bested me.
§7[4/6] §2Dr. Legendary: §aI trust that you have received all of your tokens. You can make yourself a powerful accessory with all of those.
§7[5/6] §2Dr. Legendary: §aYou've earned those tokens, but they might not be enough to maximize the power of an accessory.
§7[6/6] §2Dr. Legendary: §aYou'll have to go through the challenge all over again if you want more tokens. And I'm ready for a rematch any time!
§7[1/5] §2Dr. Legendary: §aDrat! And those mechs were so expe- Oh! Great job defeating Death Metal!
§7[2/5] §2Dr. Legendary: §aBut this next one might be the end of you. The jungles of Wynn also spoke of a creature far more powerful and dangerous than the Idol.
§7[3/5] §2Dr. Legendary: §aWhile I was unable to approach it myself, a man outside of a temple told me all about the monster in question.
§7[4/5] §2Dr. Legendary: §aWhich is why I am proud to present you the §e§lMechorrupter of Worlds§a, the first enemy of the Gold Tier!
§7[5/5] §2Dr. Legendary: §aThe reward for forfeit, to your right, isn't too bad. You can stop now if you want, or risk it all and keep going!
§7[1/5] §2Dr. Legendary: §aCongratulations! You've defeated your first challenger of the Gold tier! That's more than most can say.
§7[2/5] §2Dr. Legendary: §aBut you're bound to have heard of the next challenger. During my Corkus-funded travels, I heard every story of Bob known to man.
§7[3/5] §2Dr. Legendary: §aI amassed all of my research into one of my finest creations! So I wish you good luck in defeating the one and only...
§7[4/5] §2Dr. Legendary: §e§lRobob's Reinvention§a!
§7[5/5] §2Dr. Legendary: §aWhile I applaud you for getting this far, there's never any shame in forfeitting off to the side. But the choice is still yours.
§7[1/5] §2Dr. Legendary: §aWhat happened out there? You both just stood there until you destroyed YahyaBot in one blow! The fight is still considered valid, so don't worry.
§7[2/5] §2Dr. Legendary: §aAnyways, during my Corkus-sponsored expedition, I eventually found and scaled the legendary Tower of Ascension.
§7[3/5] §2Dr. Legendary: §aUp there, I met a peculiar creature, dressed up as the spirit of Death himself! Despite being an impostor, its strength was still formidable.
§7[4/5] §2Dr. Legendary: §aSo the final fight of the Silver tier will be... §f§lDeath Metal§a!
§7[5/5] §2Dr. Legendary: §aAs I'm legally obligated to remind you, you can forfeit to your right if you want.
