§7the Lake Gylia effect
==
§7Many years ago, a scholar studied 
§7how effective Theorick's ice had been 
§7so at fighting corruption. Even through 
§7the sheer power of the Twains, 
§7however, the ice merely slows corruption. 
==
§7Families like these used to hide 
§7underground during raids. In the final 
§7raid of Nesaak, Theorick froze the 
§7entire place over - freezing them 
§7with it. 
==
§7Shortly after the portal broke into 
§7this hidden land, a beast from 
§7an unknown realm laid siege to 
§7the city forcing the Olm to 
§7his domain. 
==
§7This monument was built in memory 
§7of Bob, who supposedly fell to 
§7wild wolves here. Those who knew 
§7him have their doubts, however, and 
§7the origins of the mysterious temples 
§7and tombs are unknown.

§7The besieged origin. To end, 
§7one must begin. 
§7Thought to be only a myth, 
§7this portal's existence confirms the legends 
§7that the Silent Expanse is a 
§7road to Dern. How to access 
§7it, though, is perhaps a mystery 
§7that can't be solved yet... 
§7The unrighteous sought it. The 
§7noble hid it. The one 
§7seeking answers found more questions. 
§7Another beginning...to a new end. 
§7Head to town and get 
§7further information from the employee. 
§7Climb up the tree and 
§7look through the window. 
§7Head to the northern part 
§7of the bank and find 
§7a way up to the 
§7ceiling. 
§7Head back to the excavation 
§7camp. 
§7The cruel. The kind. The 
§7selfish. The just. He who 
§7travelled life with confliction. Who 
§7faced eternity served cold. To 
§7his end. 
§7Head to Nesaak and locate 
§7Theorick. 
§7Defeat Theorick 
§7An end, ousted by further 
§7action. An end, brought to 
§7six. An end, to the 
§7surety of the haughty. An 
§7end, of the world...in some 
§7fashion. 
§7Enter the Corrupter of World 
§7end of the cave. 
§7Return back up the cave 
§7and fix a way out. 
§7Metal. Preventing an end. Life. 
§7Ends, prevented. Does metal taking 
§7life, bringing an end, truly 
§7prevent more? 
§7Trick 3 people to follow 
§7you into the iron golem 
§7factory. 
§7and [3 Red Mushrooms] to 
§7Make your way through the 
§7A home, invaded. A society, 
§7crumbling. The people, starving. The 
§7concerned, helpless. The flames, rising. 
§7An end you will not 
§7expect. 
§7Tell the hooligans in the 
§7slums about the eviction notice. 
§7Return to the advisor for 
§7what to do next. 
§7Head deep inside the slums 
§7and blow it up. 
§7Metal. Life. A new place... 
§7One is not sacrificed for 
§7another. Always distrusting. Tension, as 
§7the clockworks chime. 
§7Find a rock to launch 
§7into the Avos territory and 
§7a battery to activate the 
§7catapult. 
§7This rock can probably be used as
§7ammunition for the catapult.
§7Steal the Avos totem and 
§7activate it outside of Corkus 
§7City 
§7The totem contains a lot of magical
§7nature energy. If released
§7unknown effects may occur.
§7Climb the Corkus Clocktower.
