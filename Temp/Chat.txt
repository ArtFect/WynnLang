Господи, кто знает, что бы произошло, если бы сокровище украли прямо у нас под носом...
§7[1/1] §2Courtyard Guard: §aThem skyraider pests who broke into this courtyard tried to break into the mansion by breaking one of the mansion's windows by throwin' a rock at it, now we gotta' fix it!@§7[1/1] §2Courtyard Guard: §aЭти захватчики-вредители, которые ворвались во двор, также пытались ворваться в особняк. Они бросили камень и разбили одно из окон, теперь нам нужно его починить!

§7[1/5] §2Dr. Legendary: §aWhat a breathtaking fight! The Matrojan Idol, defeated! You're almost halfway there.@§7[1/5] §2Dr. Legendary: §aКакой захватывающий бой! Matrojan Idol повержен! Ты почти на полпути.
§7[2/5] §2Dr. Legendary: §aDuring my travels, made possible by Corkus, I eventually stumbled into the Light Forest of Gavel, where I had a strange vision...@§7[2/5] §2Dr. Legendary: §aВо время моих путешествий, ставших возможными благодаря Коркусу, я в конце концов наткнулся на Светлый Лес в провинции Гавел, где у меня было странное видение...
§7[3/5] §2Dr. Legendary: §aI saw... a villager, in his ultimate form, surrounded by mushrooms. The vision inspired me to create the next challenger.@§7[3/5] §2Dr. Legendary: §aЯ увидел... жителя, в своей ультимативной форме, окруженного грибами. Видение вдохновило меня на создание следующего претендента.
§7[4/5] §2Dr. Legendary: §aI call this robot... §f§lYahyaBot V4.04§a!@§7[4/5] §2Dr. Legendary: §aЯ назвал этого робота... §f§lYahyaBot V4.04§a!
§7[5/5] §2Dr. Legendary: §aAs always, you can forfeit to your right, or you can continue up ahead!@§7[5/5] §2Dr. Legendary: §aКак всегда, справа ты можешь потерять все, или же можешь продолжить идти вперед!
§7[1/5] §2Dr. Legendary: §aAstounding! Very few have ever slain Robob. But this next challenger is known to very few, and still remains undefeated.@§7[1/5] §2Dr. Legendary: §aПоразительно! Очень немногие когда-либо убивали Robob'а. Но этот следующий претендент известен очень немногим, и все еще остается непобежденным.
§7[2/5] §2Dr. Legendary: §aYou've likely heard of Wybels. Have you heard stories of an orange one? They say an orange wybel is very intelligent and powerful.@§7[2/5] §2Dr. Legendary: §aТы, вероятно, слышал о Вубелах. Слышал историю об оранжевом? Говорят, что оранжевый Вубел очень умный и сильный.
§7[3/5] §2Dr. Legendary: §aI was unable to match its strength with electromagic alone, so I took a live Orange Wybel and... "upgraded" it into...@§7[3/5] §2Dr. Legendary: §aЯ не смог сопоставить его силу с электромагией в одиночку, поэтому я взял живого оранжевого Вубела и... "модернизировал" его в...
§7[4/5] §2Dr. Legendary: §aThe §e§lOrange Cybel§a, the final challenger of the Gold tier. If you defeat it, you'll even be able to challenge the Diamond tier.@§7[4/5] §2Dr. Legendary: §e§lOrange Cybel§a - последний претендент Золотого уровня. Если ты победишь его, то даже сможешь попробовать пройти Алмазный уровень.
§7[5/5] §2Dr. Legendary: §aIf you truly believe in your strength, continue. If not, I'd advise you to forfeit now. Your reward is already sizable.@§7[5/5] §2Dr. Legendary: §aЕсли ты действительно веришь в свои силы, продолжай. Если нет, я бы посоветовал тебе отказаться сейчас. Твоя награда уже значительна.
§7[1/8] §2Dr. Legendary: §aAmazing! You even defeated the Cybel, my strongest creation. Well, except for one thing...@§7[1/8] §2Dr. Legendary: §aПотрясающе! Ты даже победил Cybel'а, мое самое сильное создание. Ну, за исключением одной вещи...
§7[2/8] §2Dr. Legendary: §aWith the help of Corkus, I travelled to the Hive, where I sought to model the final challenger after the legendary sorceress.@§7[2/8] §2Dr. Legendary: §aС помощью Коркуса я отправился в Улей, где попытался изобразить последнего претендента в честь легендарной волшебницы.
§7[3/8] §2Dr. Legendary: §aBut... Qira declined. She said that if I tried anyway, she'd, erm... well, let's just say killing me was putting it too lightly.@§7[3/8] §2Dr. Legendary: §aНо... Кира отказалась. Она сказала, что если я все равно попытаюсь, она ... ну, скажем так, убьет меня слишком легко.
§7[4/8] §2Dr. Legendary: §aIt might be for the best, anyways. If the stories about her are true, her immense skill might be impossible to replicate.@§7[4/8] §2Dr. Legendary: §aВ любом случае, это может быть к лучшему. Если рассказы о ней правдивы, ее огромное мастерство может быть невозможно воспроизвести.
§7[5/8] §2Dr. Legendary: §aSo instead, I made something else, something entirely new...@§7[5/8] §2Dr. Legendary: §aВместо этого, я сделал кое-то еще, что-то совершенно новое...
§7[6/8] §2Dr. Legendary: §aA mech suit that will be piloted by me, §b§lDoctor Legendary§a! With it, I might be one of the toughest foes you'll ever face!@§7[6/8] §2Dr. Legendary: §aМеханический костюм, который буду пилотировать я - §b§lDoctor Legendary§a! С ним я буду одним из самых жестких врагов, с которыми ты когда-либо сталкивался!
§7[7/8] §2Dr. Legendary: §aBut if you can defeat me, you'll get §b1 Diamond Token§a, §e7 Gold Tokens§a, §f15 Silver Tokens§a, and §625 Bronze Tokens§a!@§7[7/8] §2Dr. Legendary: §aНо если ты сможешь победить меня, ты получишь §b1 Алмазный жетон§a, §e7 золотых жетонов§a, §f15 серебряных жетонов§a и §625 бронзовых жетонов§a!
§7[8/8] §2Dr. Legendary: §aIt's not too late to forfeit, if you want. But I have a feeling you've got one more fight in you.@§7[8/8] §2Dr. Legendary: §aЕще не поздно сдаться, если хочешь. Но у меня такое чувство, что в тебе есть еще силы на борьбу.
§7[1/1] §2Rayshyroth: §aYou're a rather impressive one, aren't you! I'm glad to see you survived, and no worse for wear!@§7[1/1] §2Rayshyroth: §aТы выглядишь довольно впечатленным, не так ли! Я рад, что ты выжил, и не пострадал!

§7[2/5] §2Cinfras Citizen: §aI bet she also made you swear off telling people about your request. I hear she does that, among other things.
§7[3/5] §2Cinfras Citizen: §aI hope you didn't try to ask that she quit her evil ways and retire, though. That's what that first group tried to do, and they got laughed off.
§7[4/5] §2Cinfras Citizen: §aAnd then, a few days after word got out that they'd told people their request, they disappeared. She enslaved the poor blokes.

§7[2/6] §2Hive Servant: §aI hope you didn't hurt her too bad, and that she didn't rough you up too harsh either. For someone with your skill, getting hurt is a waste, I think.
§7[3/6] §2Hive Servant: §aI mean, even just beating the Thunder Division is certainly more than I could ever hope to achieve, eheheh...
§7[4/6] §2Hive Servant: §aI'm fine just being a cog in the clockworks, so to speak, but some of the other servants dislike their positions here. I just can't understand them.
§7[5/6] §2Hive Servant: §aMistress is a fine ruler. She keeps us safe, her rules aren't overbearing, she's infinitely wise... What have they got to hold against her?
