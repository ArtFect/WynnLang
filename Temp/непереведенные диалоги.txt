§7[1/1] §2Prison Guard: §aYou are trespassing on private property. Just get out of here, our cells are too full. We prefer 72's and up anyway.
§7[1/1] §2Prison Guard: §aNo trespassing!
§7[1/1] §2The Guardian: §aStranger! If you value your life, you will walk away, and never return!
§7[1/5] §2Llevigar Citizen: §aNo, no, no, that can't be right... She couldn't have possibly gotten them into the city yet...
§7[2/5] §2Llevigar Citizen: §aHm- Whuh! H-Human! My land, but you can be quiet with all that armour on! §aEr...how§a much §adid...you§a hear, of that?
§7[3/5] §2Llevigar Citizen: §aY-Yes, well... You're probably new to Gavel, so I'll inform you. I was worrying over a creation of 'Mistress' Qira.
§7[4/5] §2Llevigar Citizen: §aSome kind of plant monster, sent to spy on us! There have been a rash of sightings recently, and the gardeners are lodging complaints.
§7[5/5] §2Llevigar Citizen: §aIf you have any sense, you'll follow my advice: Do not go anywhere near that blasted Hive of hers! You'll end up dead, or enslaved, §aor...or...or§a worse!!
§7[1/1] §2Edula: §aWhat is a Wynn warrior doing all the way over here?
§7[1/2] §2Arzul: §aWe have §aseparate...sleeping§a §aquarters...for§a Doguns and Dwarves.
§7[2/2] §2Arzul: §aWe §awould...melt§a the §abeds...they§a sleep in... After §aall...we§a §aare...molten§a rock.
§7[1/3] §2Adoda: §aA fire starter? Yeah, I think I left one on the roof.
§7[2/3] §2Adoda: §aIf you can get up there you can help yourself to it.
§7[3/3] §2Adoda: §aI wasted a lot of money on that thing. Turns out lava does the same job.
§7[1/1] §2Aledar: §aNo no no, these are gems! I said to make §3[2 Ingots]§a! Make sure to §bleft-click§a when refining.
§7[1/1] §2Yansur: §aCome back when you are level 80. We will not accept applicants of the challenge who are not thoroughly prepared.
§7[1/1] §2Grenot: §aHey! Don't go in there, the mine is too dangerous!
§7[1/3] §2Aledar: §aOkay, you've refined the string. Follow me for the next step in the crafting process.
§7[1/1] §2Eltom Guard: §aGreetings, citi- hold on a second, you're not from here, are you?
§7[1/1] §2Salesman: §aThose tightwad mages are out in Dernel, on the lake with the big island. I doubt you'll convince them to give you any healing water, though.
§7[1/1] §2Office Manager: §aHey! you are not permitted to enter the office!
§7[1/11]§0 §2Scientist Ynnos:§a *Ahem* Welcome, everyone.
§7[2/11]§0 §2Scientist Ynnos:§0 §aI am Ynnos, one of the leading scientists in Gavel. You’re here because.. Well you read the help wanted sign.
§7[3/11]§0 §2Scientist Ynnos:§0 §aAllow me to explain the situation we’re in. It’s a series of unfortunate events. I study the amazing properties of crystals and other geodes.
§7[4/11]§0 §2Scientist Ynnos:§0 §aI was funded by a private organisation, however that seems to have stopped. So.. We had to make cuts in the budget.
§7[5/11]§0 §2Scientist Ynnos:§0 §aOne of those, was using cheaper rope. While moving the crystal across Ahmsord, well, it snapped. The crystal fell.
§7[6/11]§0 §2Scientist Ynnos:§0 §aI can not stress the value of that crystal. It had many unique properties that are allowing me to understand why the sky islands float the way they do.
§7[7/11]§0 §2Scientist Ynnos:§0 §aThey hold the very key to restoring this land to being whole once more... But it’s gone.
§7[8/11]§0 §2Scientist Ynnos:§0 §aFortunately, I detected an impact. It’s hit something down in the void. We’re not sure what, however or how deep.
§7[9/11]§0 §2Scientist Ynnos:§0 §aYour mission will be to retrieve the crystal in a specially designed ship to withstand the void. We barely scraped it out of the budget, so try to bring it back in one piece.
§7[10/11]§0 §2Scientist Ynnos:§0 §aIf you think you are not up for the challenge, leave now...
§7[11/11]§0 §2Scientist Ynnos:§0 §aWhen you think you are ready, exit the room behind me and meet me at the dock as soon as possible.
§7[2/2] §2Kantor §aThis is the ship's mechanic. There appears to be a fault on the middle deck. I request urgent assistance.
§7[1/1] §2Kantor: §aThanks again for helping me! We’ve still got a long trip ahead of us, you should go and rest for a while.
§7[1/2] §2Burne: §aThanks for saving us back there.
§7[2/2] §2Burne: §aLet's hope nothing else goes wrong!
§7[1/2] §2Manny: §aI wonder what we'll find on the void island!
§7[2/2] §2Manny: §aI'm excited, actually.
§7[1/1]§0 §2Captain Olof:§0 §aWe have encountered our first island, 100m down. Crew members, climb up the ladder and search the island for the crystal.
§7[3/3] §2Captain Olof: §aAnyway, let's explore the island, look for the crystal, and return to Ahmsord!
§7[1/2] §2Kantor: §aOh no, this isn't good. The windshield is destroyed...
§7[2/2] §2Kantor: §aI thought this trip was going to be easy.
§7[1/2] §2Kantor: §aWhat's that smell?
§7[2/2] §2Kantor: §aIt smells §areally...sterile§a? Does this mean I have to work...?
§7[3/5]§2 Jesp:§a This is hard, but we'll make it!
§7[4/5]§2 Arlene:§a Be careful, it seems to be getting tougher. The bridge is soon ready to use
§7[5/5]§2 Manny:§a Hey, the bridge is ready!
§7[1/4] §2Rex: §aWe didn't find the crystal here either. Maybe it just fell in the void?
§7[2/4] §2Manny: §aNo, it must have hit an island. The scientist said he detected a collision.
§7[3/4] §2Rex: §aWait.. What's that sound?
§7[4/4] §2Manny: §aThe ropes are snapping! Quick! Abandon ship!
§7[1/13] §2Celuuse: §aWhoooooooo are you!?
§7[2/13] §2Celuuse: §aA...HUUUUUUMAN!§a? In the void?
§7[3/13] §2Celuuse: §aSomeone dropped a boooook about you people! Warriors! Workers!
§7[4/13] §2Celuuse: §aAh. Yoooou want to know about this place?
§7[5/13] §2Celuuse: §aWell... We were once Villagers. I think we still are, a bit.
§7[6/13] §2Celuuse: §aFor some reason, 1000 years agoooo. The sky islands ruptured.
§7[7/13] §2Celuuse: §aSome stayed. Others fell. We somehow survived the fall into the vooooid.
§7[8/13] §2Celuuse: §aHow we have lived for so long, I doooo not know. But one thing we know for sure. The void provides.
§7[9/13] §2Celuuse: §aWe are stuck here now. The void has forever changed our physiology.
§7[10/13] §2Celuuse: §aThe crystal yoooou are looking for fell on this island. But...
§7[11/13] §2Celuuse: §aWe need it. It will aid us for years.
§7[12/13] §2Celuuse: §aWe have very limited resources here. That’s why a power source like this is soooo valuable.
§7[13/13] §2Celuuse: §aIf you go to the east, you will find Rontaid our chief scientist. He'll know what to doooo.
§7[1/2] §2Vonlus: §aThe crops didn't adapt like we did.
§7[2/2] §2Vonlus: §aLet's hope the kitchen keeps throwing out all that food. The void always provides...
§7[1/8] §2Rontaid: §aWHAT...WHO...Humans§a in the void!?
§7[2/8] §2Rontaid: §aWell, looks like the book we found wasn't fiction after all!
§7[3/8] §2Rontaid: §aThis crystal is going toooo be our saviour. I was trying to create one of my own, you know.
§7[4/8] §2Rontaid: §aI think I have the formula, but we don't have what we need to make it.
§7[5/8] §2Rontaid: §aInstead of taking this crystal back, why don't I exchange it for the recipe?
§7[6/8] §2Rontaid: §aThat way, you can make however many crystals youuuu want, and we can keep this one.
§7[7/8] §2Rontaid: §aHere's the recipe, give it to a scientist or someone a §abit...smarter§a than yourself. No offense.
§7[8/8] §2Rontaid: §aA platform was lowered from the surface a while ago at your crash site, as well. If youuuu wish to return, follow this path, I made a shortcut.
§7[1/10] §2Scientist Ynnos: §aYou survived! Where is everyone else?
§7[2/10] §2Scientist Ynnos: §a...
§7[3/10] §2Scientist Ynnos: §aI knew some must have died... But all of them?
§7[4/10] §2Scientist Ynnos: §aWell... At least I don't have to pay them! Hah!
§7[5/10] §2Scientist Ynnos: §a...That§a was heartless of me, I'm sorry. The rope we used was too weak to hold you down there.
§7[6/10] §2Scientist Ynnos: §aMy calculations didn't account for the void's physics, it seems.
§7[7/10] §2Scientist Ynnos: §aAt least we got you back in one piece. You can tell us what happened.
§7[8/10] §2Scientist Ynnos: §a...
§7[9/10] §2Scientist Ynnos: §aWell I'll be damned. I'll start sending post down there! We can work together.
§7[10/10] §2Scientist Ynnos: §aBetter to keep everything that happened here a secret. I don't want to lose what little funding I have. This recipe is genius! Here, take this, as well as your money.
§7[2/2] §2????: §aSPEAKING OF WHICH, WHY DON'T YOU JUST KEEP CRAWLING THROUGH THESE VENTS AND JUST BURN YOURSELF UP FOR ME? IT WOULD MAKE MY LIFE MUCH EASIER.
§7[1/3]§2 Antikythera Supercomputer: §aI SEE MY PERSUASIVE SKILLS HAVE NOT MOVED YOU. I THINK I'LL TRY AGAIN IN A LANGUAGE YOU SEEM TO KNOW INTIMATELY.
§7[2/3]§2 Antikythera Supercomputer: §aTHAT IS TO SAY, UNRELENTING AND EXCESSIVE FORCE. WITH RAILGUNS. AND A SIEGE ENGINE.
§7[3/3]§2 Antikythera Supercomputer: §aIF THAT STILL ISN'T ENOUGH TO GET THE MESSAGE OF “I AM GOING TO KILL YOU” THROUGH YOUR SKULL, I'LL HAVE TO DEVOTE SERIOUS TIME TO LEARNING HOW TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOU.
§7[1/1] §2Burtur: §aPlease...the§a grave site's just north of here, across the busted bridge. Help a poor ol' dyin' man out...
§7[1/1] §2???: §aWhoever you are, leave! You're not welcome here!
§7[1/1] §2The Secretary: §aHow's the mission going?
§7[1/1] §2Captain Olof: §aGo rest up; The mechanic and I can take care of this ourselves.
§7[1/2] §2Rontaid: §aI hope you make use of our science.
§7[2/2] §2Rontaid: §aWe don't want another village to fall down here... I'm not sure we could provide for even more people.
§7[1/2] §2Scientist Ynnos: §aI'm working on a replacement for the crystal now... 
§7[2/2] §2Scientist Ynnos: §aThese void villagers are rather smart, but their handwriting is utterly atrocious.
