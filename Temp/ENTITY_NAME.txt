§a§oOh no...
§a§oGah! I got hit!!
§a§oI'm not staying around here!
§a§oI can't see...
§a§oSoldier, DO something!!
§a§oCast a spell! That'll scare it off!
§a§oSeth, it's a good thing you ran away.
§a§oWhat's even happening up there?
§a§oOh, nothing really, we all just might die.
§a§oI'm getting dizzy..!
§a§oSeriously, that soldier is really bad at this...
§a§oHave you heard about that colossal rat?
§a§oHow about we don't talk about that...
§a§oThe sea's nice today...
§a§oSay... Do you have anything planned tomorrow?
§a§oI don't know, do you?
§a§oLast night I dreamt of this boat being
§a§omade of bricks...
§a§oAnd I dreamt of Seth's incessant blabbering.
§a§o*yawn*
§a§oWhat are we even guarding?
§a§oI mean, we have an actual soldier...
§a§oAlright... What about the soldier?
§a§oI should do something!
§a§oOf course I gotta be the one to clean...
§a§oSnoo??
§a§oWhat is he...
§a§oWha-
§a§oShe's good at dodgin'!
§a§oI don't know, they're just... watching!
§a§oOUCH!
§a§oHonip made 'em clean the puppets...
§a§oDid you know one of the mates
§a§okeeps talking about a "zombie" pet?
§a§oWhat? Does he want to corrupt himself?
§a§oThis... has turned into a difficult situation.
§a§oI really thought they'd help with other stuff...
==
§a§o§lDon't touch me.
§a§oAre you alright?
§a§oYou shouldn't have done that.
§a§oNow you've done it,
§a§oRickeo.
§a§oMael!
§a§oTheo, stop.
§a§oJust this once.
§a§oStop.
§a§o§lMake me.
§a§oThanks, Ricke...
§a§oDon't worry about it...
§a§oLet's finish this, shall we?
§a§oYeah. Dad should have done
§a§othis a long time ago.
§a§o§lENOUGH.
§a§oAre you out of your minds??
§a§oYou were about to §lkill §a§oyour brother!
§a§oI... You're... right. We...
§a§oYou should leave. All of you. This
§a§oisn't what being a Twain was about...
§a§oMph. None of us are Twains. Not me.
§a§oNot you. We're an old man's
§a§odelusion.
§a§o...
§a§oMael... I...
§a§oI know, Ricke. Just go.
§a§oDad... I'm sorry...
§a§oWhat does all this mean?
§a§oThe Twains are over?
==
§a§oTake THIS!
§a§oWhat even are they for again?
§a§oSome weird scheme?...
§a§oGah!
§a§oGah, would they STOP making a mess!
§a§oI didn't sign up for this!
§a§oI need to leave!
§a§oThe soldier's so useless I'm terrified of
§a§ochecking the deck...
§a§oStop right there, foul beast!
§a§o...cute...
§a§oOh god, has my time come?
§a§oNo, it hasn't!
§a§oOh, I see you're all here!
§a§oWell, the soldier isn't exactly the greatest.
§a§oI'm just goin' to... rest.
§a§oHey... You missed quite the scene up there.
§o§aAgh!
