§7[2/7] §2Honip: §aIt doesn't seem too difficult though, a little to the left...
§7[3/7] §2Honip: §aHmm, looks like we're not the only ones out on the water today.
§7[4/7] §2Honip: §aThey are a bit too head on, don't you think?
§7[5/7] §2Honip: §aI'm trying to steer the ship but it's not budging...
§7[6/7] §2Honip: §aThat's unfortunate...
§7[3/4] §2Honip: §aWell, shiver me timbers! You did redeem yourself, soldier!
§7[1/1] §2Seth: §aHonip's probably waitin' for ya by now!
§7[1/2] §2Seth: §aWelcome back! Any progress?
§7[2/2] §2Pirate: §aSnoo saved us all, right? What a crazy lad, heh!
§7[1/3] §2Honip: §aHey there fella'. So, the rat situation..?
§7[2/3] §2Honip: §aOh, you're not done yet?
§7[3/3] §2Honip: §aTake it slowly if ya want, that place gives me the creeps...
§7[3/3] §2Honip: §aEager, are ya? Well, that's great!
§7[2/2] §2Pirate: §aI take back what I said earlier, you might not be a chicken slaughterer.

§7[1/1] §2Una: §aOhp, hold on a sec there! Can't take your classes without your materials! The shops are out on the docks.
§7[1/1] §2Teacher: §aI know you're eager, but this is dangerous! Stay seated, please.
§7[1/1] §2Headmaster: §aThe element of nature and physicality. Now, choose a Practical Magic lesson.
§7[1/9] §2Teacher: §aNow, all of you. Sit. Listen.
§7[1/1] §2Teacher: §aRemove the dark stone using your earth magic by right click the tome.
§7[2/9] §2Teacher: §aEarth is an element of great power. Versatile and everpresent, nearly as the air.
§7[3/9] §2Teacher: §aThunder provides force... Earth provides sheer power. The difference... Force chooses its own path. Power is force, directed.
§7[4/9] §2Teacher: §aEarth is also the earth itself. Stone, metal, trees and soil. Trees sway in the wind, but do not break. And the mountains do not crumble.
§7[5/9] §2Teacher: §aThe Touroto, steeped in earthly magic, are nearly invincible to all but themselves. It is proof of the earth's strength.
§7[6/9] §2Teacher: §aThe Doguns... They were masters of the earth, and fire alike, shaping caverns to their will... And now, nearly extinct. A terrible crime...
§7[7/9] §2Teacher: §aBut we shall honor them, and move forward. We shall strike the earth and claim it to be our own.
§7[8/9] §2Teacher: §aThe tome directs the earth's force. Take it, and utilize it to shatter the stones I summon.
§7[9/9] §2Teacher: §aThe darkest parts of the stone are weak points. Find them, and learn the power of the earth.
§7[1/1] §2Teacher: §aUh oh.... Time is up! Try again!
§7[1/1] §2Teacher: §aYou know the earth's power, fledgeling. There is nothing more for you here. Go.
§7[1/1] §2Headmaster: §aA true wizard after my own heart, seeking wisdom! Good choice. Now, choose a Practical Magic lesson.
§7[1/8] §2Teacher: §aAah, wow! Everyone s-sure got here quick...
§7[2/8] §2Teacher: §aWelcome, w-welcome. The Water element class §ais...certainly§a an interesting one, I-I'd hope... Because water doesn't j-just pertain to, well, w-water...
§7[3/8] §2Teacher: §aIt also is the element o-of knowledge, and pure magicality. Water i-is a sort of magical default, if you w-will. If it isn't focused on o-one element or another, magic ends up being water-based.
§7[4/8] §2Teacher: §aLearning a-about the water element and e-expanding your horizons can allow you to cast spells easier... C-control the flow of magic better, you see.
§7[5/8] §2Teacher: §aMost aquatic creatures are t-tied to water, though creatures that live in icy or snowy environments are, §at-too...often§a, they are also connected to air, but not always.
§7[6/8] §2Teacher: §aIn a-addition, many holy artifacts are enchanted with water magic... S-something about how it's a pure type of energy, I believe.
§7[7/8] §2Teacher: §aLastly, healing abilities are b-bolstered by water magic. Just knowing magic well d-doesn't help, but actually having artifacts charged w-with water magic can increase healing capabilities.
§7[8/8] §2Teacher: §aN-now, for your test, I §ahave...um§a, a...a test. Anyone who wants to try it f-first, just go up and start.
§7[1/2] §2Teacher: §aGood w-work there! I h-hope I wasn't too boring with all my talking... You can go now.
§7[2/2] §2Teacher: §aN-now, who's n-next? And...i-is it really cold in here for all of you, too? Or, is it j-just me...?
§7[1/1] §2Teacher: §aP-please sit down, fledgeling!

§7With so much of the active army dead, dying, and corrupted, Ragni fell within the day.
§7The King of Ragni sought help from Troms, the most secure fortress in the province. But help was too late.
§7When the armies of Troms reached the once noble fort, it was corrupted ashes.
§7After a villager took over, new laws were put in place. This was the spark Wynnexcavation needed to start their work.
§7The humans didn't notice any difference after the new laws, but the company was in full force...
§7The roaring of the Corrupter of Worlds is audible from here. Has he noticed you?
§7Maybe you can create a trail of emeralds and lure the villager back to the factory?
§7Maybe you can lure the villager by flirting?
§7After the King of Rodoroc ordered the slums cave-in, another war broke out.
§7But this time, it was between Dwarves and Dwarves... And yet again blood was spilled.
§7[+1 Avo Totem]
§7You need to catch Maxie before he reaches the war scene.
§7Maxie never made it back to the war scene. The civil war advanced faster than anyone could have anticipated.
§7The once peaceful Avos were forced to flee their home island, ravaged by machines and toxic scrap...
§7...and§7 the Corkians, blindsided by the Factory's reactivation, were purged by metal and electricity.
§7In time, Corkus became known as the island torn apart by war. Its name would live on in infamy.
§7After the two soldiers were slain in battle, Detlas crumbled.
§7It stood as a monument to wealth, prosperity, and power in the Wynn province. It now stands as a corrupted wasteland.
§7The ruins of the city are a grim reminder of the power of corruption. And §7so...the§7 people began to lose hope.
§7You have gained the power to end. You have unlocked §4The Hunted Mode§7.
§7But you've already seen the lock. The key is still nowhere to be found!
§4You can't just leave your graduation like that!
§7Without a clue of what happened you shouldn't just leave!
§4This area is too dangerous to be in. Find a way around!
§4You can barely see anything in this cave. You can also hear growls of many gerts.
§4This hole is dangerous, better not walk near it.
§4A foul stench is coming from the §4slums...it§4 makes your head swim. No sense heading in.
§4The trolls have barricaded the door...

§7[1/1] §2Captain Fenor: §aHello, recruit! I would ask you for a hand with something, but you seem too weak. Maybe when you're level 5...
§7~7[1/1] §2~2Old Man: §a~aHarvest §3~3[2 Wheat String]~r§a~a and then bring it to me.
§7[1/1] §2Retarc: §aI can finally feel my hands after all that wrapping.
§7[1/5] §2Fisherman: §aGah!
§7[2/5] §2Fisherman: §aYou startled me! Visitors are rare here!
§7[3/5] §2Fisherman: §aDespite how hostile the swamp is, I found this little pond to be quite lovely!
§7[4/5] §2Fisherman: §aLiving here is harsh, it's always nice to find a place with potential profits...
§7[5/5] §2Fisherman: §aSo, don't go and steal all MY fish, alright?
§7[1/1] §2Fisherman: §aHave you seen these beasts? Gives me shivers!
§7[1/1] §2Fisherman: §aEven with all that fancy equipment, you should be careful!
§7[1/1] §2Fisherman: §aI don't exactly know why you're here, the monsters out there are terrifying.
§7[1/1] §2Fisherman: §aSo... Do you like fishing?
§7[1/1] §2Fisherman: §aBack for more fishing?
§7[1/1] §2Felim: §aHey, did you defeat that bear? I'm grateful, but I'm waiting for a man named Dejol to come. I can't leave yet. He will find me, I know it.
§7[1/3] §2Rodoroc Citizen: §aHave you heard of our great king? The Dwarven palace is here.
§7[2/3] §2Rodoroc Citizen: §aHe rarely shows his face in public. He usually sits in his palace directing the city.
§7[3/3] §2Rodoroc Citizen: §aI'm afraid it's not possible to visit him at all. The palace is shut.
§7[1/1] §2Nettik: §aWhat do you think you're doing?
§7[1/2] §2Thesead Citizen: §aIf you follow the path out of Thesead to the northeast, you'll find the Molten Heights, a dangerous volcanic land.
§7[2/2] §2Thesead Citizen: §aThat area is infamous due to a war that took place between the Dwarves and Doguns.
§7[1/1] §2Death: §aIF YOU HEAR SCREAMING, DON'T WORRY. IT'S JUST THE WALLS.
§7[1/1] §2Qira: §a§lLeaving so soon? §a§lHaha...not§a§l until I am through with you. I must see what you are capable of...
§7[1/2] §2Cinfras Citizen: §aThe big clock in the Guild Hall never actually moves, I think it must be broken.
